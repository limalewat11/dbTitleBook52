Midway through college, she has finished a novel&#x2014;and manages to find a seasoned agent, then a publisher. But as she climbs the ladder of publishing success, she resolutely adheres to her father&#x2019;s admonition: Men read crime thrillers by men only&#x2014;and so Alexandra Winslow publishes under the pseudonym Alexander Green, her true identity known only to those closest to her, creating a double life that isolates her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her secret life as the mysterious and brilliantly successful Alexander Green&#x2014;and her own life as a talented young woman&#x2014;expose her to the envious, the arrogant, and Hollywood players who have no idea who she really is.

Sometimes their fights lasted for hours. They always ended with a door slamming, and then her father would come up to see her in her bedroom and tell her everything was fine.<br><br>They had been arguing for an hour this time, and Alex could hear her mother screaming. She had a hot Latin temper, and Alex could remember her parents&#x2019; arguments for as long as she&#x2019;d been alive. They had gotten worse in the last year or two, and afterward her mother would be gone for a few days, or a few weeks sometimes, and everything would be quiet for a while when she came back. And then it would start again, like tonight. Her mother had said at dinner that she wanted to go to Miami for a few days to see friends, her father had reminded her unhappily that she&#x2019;d just been there, and then they sent Alex upstairs. Her mother didn&#x2019;t care who heard them fight, but her father always sent Alex to her room. She put her pillows over her head as she tried not to listen, but you could hear them all over the house. They lived in a residential neighborhood of Boston, and sometimes Alex&#x2019;s friends next door said they could hear them too. Her mother did most of the shouting, and threw things sometimes, while Alex&#x2019;s father tried to calm her down before she broke something or one of the neighbors called the police. That hadn&#x2019;t happened yet, but he was afraid that one day it might.<br><br>Carmen Cortez and Eric Winslow had met in Miami when he was there on a business trip. He was the head of a construction firm that built office buildings and specialized in banks. He was there for a job they were bidding on, and had gone to dinner alone at a lively restaurant on the first night of his trip. He had seen a group of attractive young people walk in, and heard them speaking Spanish when they sat down at a table next to his, and a spectacular looking young woman had instantly caught his eye. Sensing him watching her, she had glanced over and smiled at him. He was a goner after that.<br><br>Eric was a sensible man with a quiet life. He had been married to a college professor who had died of breast cancer two years before, after putting up a noble fight. They had no children, and had made a conscious decision not to have any, due to health problems his wife had had all her life. They had never been unhappy about their decision, and accepted it as a reasonable choice for them.<br><br>He had done well at his job over the years, Barbara enjoyed her work teaching American history at Boston University, and they loved their home, which felt too large for him without her. He had expected them to spend their golden years together and hadn&#x2019;t anticipated being widowed at forty-�eight. That hadn&#x2019;t been in their plan, and once she was gone, he felt like a marble in a shoebox, rolling around, lost at home, as he sat alone reading in his den every night. Everything seemed so meaningless without her. He traveled for business frequently, but there was no one to come home to, no one to tell about the projects he was working on, and he had thought this trip to Miami would be no different. The silence in the house would be deafening when he got back. Their housekeeper, Elena, still came in several times a week and prepared meals she left for him in the freezer, and he put them in the microwave when he got home from work. He had no family, no siblings, no children, and he felt like a fifth wheel now with their friends, and spent most of his nights and weekends alone. His only pleasure and distraction were the crime thrillers he loved to read. He had a bookcase full of them.<br><br>He was surprised when a live salsa band started playing at the restaurant during dinner the night he met Carmen, and even more so when she got up and invited him to dance. She was wearing a short, low-�cut red dress that clung to her perfect body, and she told him that she was a model and occasional actress. She had come from Cuba at eighteen four years before. They danced for a few minutes, and then with a warm smile she went back to her friends. He had no idea what had gotten into him when he agreed to dance with her, it was unlike him, but she was so dazzling that when she walked over to him, he couldn&#x2019;t decline. She concentrated on her friends after that, and he noticed that they laughed a lot, and he felt faintly ridiculous, but he gave her his business card when he left the restaurant, and told her where he was staying in Miami. He was certain that a woman as vivacious and young as Carmen would never call him.<br><br>&#x201c;If you ever come to Boston . . .&#x201d; he said, thinking of how foolish he sounded. He was twenty-�eight years older than she was, more than twice her age. He realized full well how old he must seem to her and her friends, but he had never met another woman as exciting in his life. She had black hair and green eyes, light olive skin, a tan, and a flawless body. He thought of her all night, and was stunned when she called him at the hotel the next morning, before he left for a meeting. He invited her to dinner, and she told him where to meet her, and he was obsessed with images of her all day.<br><br>She looked fabulous when he saw her at the restaurant, wearing a short black dress and high heels. They went dancing after dinner, and then to a bar she suggested, and they talked until four a.m. He was fascinated by her. She explained to him that she was a trade show model, and had dreams of going to L.A. or New York for a big acting career. And in the meantime, since arriving from Havana, she had worked as a waitress, a model, a bartender, and a disco dancer to make ends meet. She spoke excellent English, with an accent, and he thought she was the most beautiful girl he&#x2019;d ever seen. He was leaving for Boston the next day, but he said if his firm got the Miami project, he&#x2019;d be back in town frequently. In the end, he returned to Miami two weeks later, just to see her. They had a fantastic weekend, and within a month, he was head over heels in love, and totally besotted with her. It seemed foolish at his age, but he didn&#x2019;t care.<br><br>Eric took Carmen to restaurants she had heard of but never been to, and they went for long walks on the beach. And on the second weekend he came to visit her, she stayed at his hotel with him. Eric was a handsome man, with a trim, athletic physique, and she said she wasn&#x2019;t bothered by his age. He was aware of her financial struggles and offered to help her, but she always thanked him and declined. His firm didn&#x2019;t get the project that they&#x2019;d bid on in Miami, but three months after they started dating, in a moment of impulsive madness totally uncharacteristic of him, Eric asked Carmen to marry him. And she accepted.<br><br>They were married by a justice of the peace in Miami. Although her mother couldn&#x2019;t leave Havana, a handful of Carmen&#x2019;s friends were present, and he had arranged for a wedding dinner at the Fontainebleau Hotel, which Carmen loved. At the end of the weekend, Carmen took her three suitcases full of everything she owned and flew to Boston with him for the first time. When they arrived, he carried his exotic bride over the threshold into a world that was totally unfamiliar to her. Her first months were acute culture shock. The weather was cold and gray, and it snowed frequently, which she hated. She was cold all the time, bored while he was at work, and missed her friends. He took her to Miami after a few months to see her pals. They were all envious of her comfortable new life, although dubious about his age. And six months after they were married, Eric and Carmen were both surprised when they discovered she was pregnant. It was an accident, but after careful thought, Eric felt it was a fortuitous one. Having children had never been an option with Barbara&#x2019;s health, but now the idea of a baby delighted him, and he hoped it would be a son to carry on his name. He would teach him to play baseball since he was an avid sports fan, and take him to games. He might even coach him in Little League. He thought a baby would help to bond Carmen to him, since she still felt out of place in his conservative Boston world and had no friends of her own there. She didn&#x2019;t like his friends and found them boring, so they spent their time with each other.<br><br>Carmen was considerably less excited about the baby than he was, and didn&#x2019;t feel ready for motherhood at twenty-�two. It would shelve her modeling career for a year, although she hadn&#x2019;t been able to get work in Boston, and she had nothing to do all day. Eventually she watched Spanish soap operas on TV until Eric got home from work, and waited for the baby to arrive. It was due in February. And having convinced each other it was a boy, they decorated the nursery in blue. Eric could hardly contain himself he was so excited, and bought a box of cigars to hand out on the big day.<br><br>Alexandra was born on the night of a blizzard in Boston. The delivery was worse than anything Carmen had imagined, and than he had feared. The doctor said it was normal for a first labor to be lengthy, and for the delivery to be as rough as it was. Carmen didn&#x2019;t even want to see the baby once it was born. Eric had been in the delivery room with her, and there was a shocked silence when the doctor announced that it was a girl. It took Eric several hours to get over his disappointment, but once he held her, he fell in love with his daughter. Carmen was heavily sedated and asleep by then, and she didn&#x2019;t adjust to the baby as easily as he did. Their housekeeper, Elena, took care of Alexandra when they got home, and all Carmen could talk about was getting her figure back and going to Miami to see her friends. She hadn&#x2019;t been in months, since Eric didn&#x2019;t want her traveling in the last stages of the pregnancy.<br><br>Going to a local gym every day and dieting, and as young as she was, Carmen got her figure back quickly, and when Alexandra was three months old, Carmen went to Miami for three days and stayed two weeks, partying with her friends. But she was in much better spirits when she got back. Eric and Elena took care of the baby whle she was away.<br><br>She made regular trips to Florida every month after that, even worked a couple of trade shows while she was there, and left the baby with Eric. She still had no friends in Boston, and their life was too boring and traditional for her. It became rapidly obvious to him that motherhood wasn&#x2019;t Carmen&#x2019;s strong suit. All she wanted was to be in Miami with her friends. And when Alex was a year old, Eric discovered that Carmen was having an affair with a male dancer in Miami. He was from Puerto Rico, and she was tearful about it when she confessed and promised it wouldn&#x2019;t happen again.<br><br>She had several slips in spite of that and committed numerous indiscretions over the years. She was lonely in Boston, she thought Eric&#x2019;s life was tedious and dull, and so was he. Despite Carmen&#x2019;s behavior, he did everything possible to keep the marriage together, for the child&#x2019;s sake as well as his. He was still very taken with his wife in the early years, until it finally dawned on him when Alex was three years old that Carmen was never going to settle down and didn&#x2019;t love him. She might stay with him for practical reasons, and the perks of his lifestyle, but she wasn&#x2019;t in love with him. Eric&#x2019;s worst fear was that she would take the child and leave him, and he didn&#x2019;t want to lose Alex, or even share custody. He knew that if Carmen left him and took Alex to Miami, it would be an unsavory life for the little girl, among Carmen&#x2019;s loosely behaved friends. Alex was his daughter and he wanted her to live a wholesome, traditional life, not the haphazard, dubious one her mother engaged in as soon as she went back to her old familiar world.<br><br>The only way Eric managed to keep the marriage together was by letting Carmen do what she wanted, come and go as she pleased, and he turned a blind eye to her affairs, although he could always tell when there was a new man in her life. She spent all her time on the phone, smiling happily when she got calls from him.</p><h2>Rhode Island Red (A Mask Noir Title)</h2><p>Nanette, a young Black woman with a degree in French and a penchant for playing the saxophone, must clear her name when an undercover police officer is found dead in her apartment</p><p>Charlotte Carter has a lifelong love of crime fiction. She was born in the Midwest but now lives in New York City with her husband and cat.Rhode Island Red is not only a quick read, it's a good one. Author Charlotte Carter let me live in New York City for two hours; I finally found out exactly where Hell's Kitchen is, and without threat to my life. The mystery itself kept me guessing until the very end as to who the villain was, and the twist was authentic. Nanette, Carter's female protagonist, is a single, somewhat struggling musician living in the heart of Manhattan. Carter's take on this theme is original. Nanette is a saxophone player, African American, described as a Grace Jones look-alike, street wise as well as fashion conscious, and filled with insatiable curiosity. With all this in mind, Nanette's reactions to some of the tragedies that took place in this book were rather casual, and therefore contradictory to the character. I loved traveling through NYC, experiencing both the upper crust of life and the bottom of the toilet existence that exists in a large city. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i></p><h2>What Makes Day and Night (Let&#39;s-Read-and-Find-Out Science 2)</h2><p>'Accompanied by NASA photographs and Dorros's colorful, lively drawings, the text explains the Earth's rotation in clear and simple terms.

Evil spirits are being resurrected from beyond the grave, a supernatural force so twisted that it kills without offering the mercy of death!Howard Phillips Lovecraft (August 20, 1890 &#x2013; March 15, 1937) was an American author who achieved posthumous fame through his influential works of horror fiction. Virtually unknown and only published in pulp magazines before he died in poverty, he is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors in his genre. Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent most of his life. Among his most celebrated tales is "The Call of Cthulhu", canonical to the Cthulhu Mythos. Never able to support himself from earnings as author and editor, Lovecraft saw commercial success increasingly elude him in this latter period, partly because he lacked the confidence and drive to promote himself. He subsisted in progressively straitened circumstances in his last years; an inheritance was completely spent by the time he died at the age of 46.</p><h2>Teller of Tales: The Life of Arthur Conan Doyle</h2><p>Winner of the 1999 Edgar Award for Best Biographical Work, this is "an excellent biography of the man who created Sherlock Holmes" (David Walton, The New York Times Book Review)<br><br>This fresh, compelling biography examines the extraordinary life and strange contrasts of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the struggling provincial doctor who became the most popular storyteller of his age. From his youthful exploits aboard a whaling ship to his often stormy friendships with such figures as Harry Houdini and George Bernard Shaw, Conan Doyle lived a life as gripping as one of his adventures. Exhaustively researched and elegantly written, Teller of Tales sets aside many myths and misconceptions to present a vivid portrait of the man behind the legend of Baker Street, with a particular emphasis on the Psychic Crusade that dominated his final years-the work that Conan Doyle himself felt to be "the most important thing in the world."<br></p><p>Despite (or because of) the tremendous success of his Sherlock Holmes stories, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle always tended to play down their value and importance in his life. Just before his death in 1930, he drew a memorable sketch of his life's work. Conan Doyle portrayed events from his life as a series of packing cases being loaded onto a wagon and pulled by a flea-bitten workhorse. Perhaps the heaviest case of all, notes Daniel Stashower in his fascinating biography <i>Teller of Tales</i>, is the one that reads "Sherlock Holmes."<p> Stashower's intent is to show that Conan Doyle was <i>not</i> Sherlock Holmes, and that his life consisted of much more than the now ridiculed spiritualism to which he devoted much of his later years. He succeeds to a surprising degree, convincing us that <i>The White Company</i> and <i>Sir Nigel</i> (forgotten novels that Conan Doyle thought were his best) are indeed worth reading. As for the spiritualism, Stashower meticulously places his subject's long fascination with it into a compassionate and fully researched social context. We come away certain that Conan Doyle (along with many other worthy citizens of the period) really believed in it. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>Daniel Stashower is the author of four mystery novels and a winner of the Raymond Chandler Fulbright Fellowship in Detective and Crime Fiction Writing. He lives in Bethesda, Maryland.<br></p><h2>The Conservative Affirmation in America</h2><p>More than twenty years ago a maverick political scientist named Willmoore Kendall predicted the triumph of conservatism.&nbsp; Upon the 1963 publication of Kendall's <i>The Conservative Affirmation</i>, his former Yale student William F. Buckley, Jr. called him "one of the most superb and original political analysts of the 20th century," but even Buckley shook his head at what appeared to be Kendall's "baffling optimism."<br><br>During the 60's, Kendall stood apart from the mainstream conservative movement which he accused of being anti-populist and of "storming American public opinion from without" by wrongly assuming that the American people were essentially corrupt and "always ready to sell thier votes to the highest bidder."&nbsp; Kendall believed that Americans would come to actively realize the conservatism which they had always actually lived.&nbsp; Seventeen years after his death in 1967, Kendall's predictions come to fruition.<br><br></p><p></p><h2>Take What You Can Carry</h2><p><p>In 1977 suburban Chicago, Kyle runs wild with his friends and learns to shoplift from the local convenience store. In 1941 Berkeley, the Himitsu family is forced to leave their home for a Japanese-American internment camp, and their teenage son must decide how to deal with his new life. But though these boys are growing up in wildly different places and times, their lives intersect in more ways than one, as they discover compassion, learn loyalty, and find renewal in the most surprising of places.</p><br><p>Kevin C. Pyle's evocative images bring to life a story of unlikely ties across space and generations.</p></p><p><p>Kevin C. Pyle is the author and illustrator of <i>Blindspot </i>and <i>Katman</i>, and his work has appeared in the <i>Village Voice</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, and <i>The New Yorker</i>. He lives in New Jersey.</p>Gr 7 Up-In 1978, Kyle, a rebellious kid in a new town, gets in over his head trying to impress his friends by shoplifting. Decades earlier, young Ken Himitsu is angry about being incarcerated in Manzanar, an internment camp where thousands of Japanese Americans were forced to relocate during World War II. The two plots intertwine in a surprising way as the boys experience parallel feelings of frustration in coping with unwanted circumstances, and both ultimately gain wisdom from an elder. Pyle's expressive artwork draws a visual distinction between the stories: the 1978 sections are illustrated with solid lines and shades of blue, while the World War II story line is rendered in sepia tones and soft brushstrokes, evocative of vintage photographs and Japanese ink wash paintings. Though Ken's story, told only in images, presents a well-researched picture of life in Manzanar, wordless storytelling might not be the ideal way to introduce this complex topic. An excellent historical note at the end of the book provides necessary context, but readers unfamiliar with the period are unlikely to have the patience to stick with a story they don't understand. Still, even if the specifics elude some teens, the essential emotions shine through. This graphic novel makes a powerful statement about respect, gratitude, and forgiveness. Readers may be compelled to learn more about the events that inspired the story, making it a good companion for nonfiction works such as Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston's Farewell to Manzanar (Houghton Mifflin, 2002) or Heather C.

If we rely on conventional economic indicators, can we ever grasp how the world&#x2019;s billions of individuals are really managing?</p><p>In this powerful critique, Martha Nussbaum argues that our dominant theories of development have given us policies that ignore our most basic human needs for dignity and self-respect. For the past twenty-five years, Nussbaum has been working on an alternate model to assess human development: the Capabilities Approach. She and her colleagues begin with the simplest of questions: What is each person actually able to do and to be? What real opportunities are available to them? </p><p>The Capabilities Approach to human progress has until now been expounded only in specialized works. <i>Creating Capabilities</i>, however, affords anyone interested in issues of human development a wonderfully lucid account of the structure and practical implications of an alternate model. It demonstrates a path to justice for both humans and nonhumans, weighs its relevance against other philosophical stances, and reveals the value of its universal guidelines even as it acknowledges cultural difference. In our era of unjustifiable inequity, Nussbaum shows how&#x2015;by attending to the narratives of individuals and grasping the daily impact of policy&#x2015;we can enable people everywhere to live full and creative lives.</p></p><p>Martha C. Nussbaum is Ernst Freund Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago, appointed in the Law School and the Philosophy Department. Among her many awards are the 2018 Berggruen Prize, the 2017 Don M. Randel Award for Humanistic Studies from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the 2016 Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy.&#x201c;A remarkably lucid and scintillating account of the the human development approach seen from the perspective of one of its major architects.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Amartya Sen, winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Economics</b><br><br>&#x201c;Nussbaum, who has done more than anyone to develop the authoritative and ground-breaking capabilities approach, offers a major restatement that will be required reading for all those interested in economic development that truly enhances how people live.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Henry Richardson, Georgetown University</b><br><br>&#x201c;A marvelous achievement: beautifully written and accessible. With Amartya Sen, Martha Nussbaum is one of the founders of the 'capability approach' to justice; the most innovative and influential development in political philosophy since the work of John Rawls. This book, for the first time, puts in one place all the central elements of Nussbaum's systematic account of the approach, together with its sources and implications.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jonathan Wolff, University College London</b><br><br>&#x201c;The very best way to be introduced to the capability approach to international development. It is also a wonderfully lucid account of the origins, justification, structure, and practical implications of her version of this powerful approach to ethically-based change in poor and rich countries.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Alan Crocker, The University of Maryland School of Public Policy</b><br><br>&#x201c;Offering a forceful and persuasive account of the failings of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as an accurate reflection of human welfare, the distinguished philosopher Nussbaum provides a framework for a new account of global development based on the concept of capabilities...The author argues that human development is best measured in terms of specific opportunities available to individuals rather than economic growth figures...This small book provides a strong foundation for beginning to think about how economic growth and individual flourishing might coincide.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Nussbaum looks at what it really means for a country to experience prosperity. Traditionally, a country's economic well-being was measured by its gross domestic product. Nussbaum takes a more personal approach by focusing on how economic prosperity plays out in ordinary citizens' lives. She analyzes the life of a woman in India by taking a close look at her situation to see what capabilities and opportunities she--and women like her--might have. The key is not to look simply at the hand they've been dealt, but whether their particular society affords them opportunities to win with it. Nussbaum calls this the "capabilities approach," and it offers a novel way to measure prosperity on a national level by seeing how well a country can provide life-changing prospects for all its citizens...By demonstrating the philosophical underpinnings of this approach and how the theory plays out in the real world, Nussbaum makes a compelling case. Not only is this a more realistic measure of wealth, but it is also a far more compassionate one. For readers who enjoy economics laced with humanity.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Carol J. Elsen</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In her new book, <i>Creating Capabilities</i>, the philosopher and legal scholar Martha Nussbaum argues that we need to refocus our ideas about development on the scale of individuals: on concrete human lives and the way they actually unfold. Quantitative measures like per capita GDP, she writes, are poor measures of development; they can't capture the shape and texture of individual lives, even though individual lives are what matter. Development isn't about how rich your nation is, on average--it's about whether people can live in a way "worthy of human dignity."...Nussbaum's book comes at an interesting time, just as growth in the rich world is slowing. That slowdown makes her ideas relevant for rich people, too. Dignified life in the rich world isn't only about being "well-fed," either...Even amid a slowdown, there are other dimensions in which life can keep improving.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Josh Rothman</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Globe online</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Renowned philosopher Nussbaum concisely captures the essential ideas of a new paradigm of social and political thought, the "human development and capabilities" approach to global social justice, founded on the work of Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen, and now used by the World Bank, the IMF, the <i>Arab Human Development Report</i>, and the United Nations Development Programme.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>S.

Moving beyond the art on the page, Andr� teaches us what it means to consider our surroundings, our daily interactions and obligations, and their effect on our inner well-being. The paintings are a visual and tangible first step to understanding mindfulness and the benefits of living in the moment. In practicing mindfulness, within ourselves and out in the world, each of us can make immediate, meaningful, and permanent changes in our well-being and the well-being of others.<br><br>Beautifully written, wonderfully accessible for any novice or expert, <i>Looking at Mindfulness</i> delivers practical steps and a comprehensive understanding of the practice and meaning of mindfulness and meditation.

This attitude can radically alter our relationship to the world, ease our suffering and enhance our joys. Mindfulness is also a type of meditation. Its basic techniques are quick and simple to learn, but take years to master fully (like everything in life that matters to us).</p><p>To move toward mindfulness we must first understand what it is and how it is practiced. The words in this book offer insight into these things. We must then free ourselves from words in order simply to sense and feel, and the paintings will help with this. Lastly we must practice and experiment on our own. Advice and exercises are suggested throughout the pages that follow. The secrets of living in mindfulness can be summed up in three words: understand, feel and practice, over and over.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Other Titles by Christophe Andre&#x301;</i></p><p><i>Title Page</i></p><p><i>Copyright</i></p><p><i>Dedication</i></p><p><i>Preface</i></p><p>PRELUDE: PRESENCE, NOT EMPTINESS</p><p>1.

Then we notice the old man sitting motionless, having turned away from his table and the book he was studying. Is he thinking? Resting? Meditating? We look to the right and notice the low cellar door, then our eyes are drawn to the spiral staircase, but we have barely registered its first few steps when we notice the fire crackling in the grate and the woman stoking it. Our eyes return to the staircase, but it leads only into darkness.</p><p>The painting is small, the place it depicts is dark, yet we have a sense of immense space. This is the genius of Rembrandt, who leads us on a visual journey through all the dimensions. We travel the painting widthways left to right, from the daylight pouring in to the fragile, almost derisory firelight. There&#x2019;s a dialogue established between the sun that lights but does not warm and the fire that warms but sheds no light. Are these the sun of reason and the fire of passion, two ingredients that combine in philosophy? We travel the painting&#x2019;s height by means of the spiral staircase that links the deep secrets of the cellar to the dark mysteries of the upper floor, and we travel its depth, from the background where the philosopher sits to the surrounding circle of shadows. But the sense of space also derives from the subtle interplay between all that is revealed and all that is hidden, where our imagination is crucial&#x2014;what lies on the other side of the window, behind the cellar door, at the top of the stairs? The largest of the worlds hidden from our restless eyes is the philosopher&#x2019;s mind, his inner world. Shadows and darkness, a little light, a little warmth and a working mind&#x2014;is that what our inner selves are like?</p><p>Meditation means stopping</p><p>Stop doing, stop moving, stop twisting and turning. Meditation means withdrawing a little, stepping back from the world.</p><p>At first what we feel seems odd. There&#x2019;s an emptiness (no action or distraction) and a fullness (a tumult of thoughts and sensations that we suddenly notice). There&#x2019;s what we lack&#x2014;points of reference and <i>things to do&#x2014;</i>and, after a little while, there&#x2019;s the calm this lack brings. Things here are not the same as they are &#x201c;outside,&#x201d; where our mind constantly attaches itself to some aim or project, acting or thinking about something in particular, having its attention held by some distraction.</p><p>The apparent inaction of the experience of meditating takes a little while to get used to. As in Rembrandt&#x2019;s painting, or when we move from light to shadow, we don&#x2019;t see clearly straightaway. We have gone inside ourselves, for real. Our inner world was close by, but we never went there. We tended to hang around outside; in today&#x2019;s world of frantic demands and frenzied connections, our relationship to ourselves often goes untended. We abandon our inner world. The outside world is easier to travel and better signposted. To meditate is often to move through a land without paths. In the room where the philosopher is meditating there&#x2019;s less light, so you have to open your eyes wider. The same is true inside ourselves. There is less that is obvious or reassuring, so we must open our mind&#x2019;s eye much wider.</p><p>We expected&#x2014;or hoped&#x2014;to find calm and emptiness. We often find ourselves in a huge, rowdy, chaotic bazaar. We aspired to clarity, we find confusion. Sometimes meditation exposes us to anxiety and pain, to things that hurt us and that we have avoided by thinking about something else or busily doing things elsewhere.</p><p>Calming agitation</p><p>It all looked so simple from the outside! We thought it would be enough just to sit down and close our eyes. But no, that&#x2019;s just the start. It&#x2019;s indispensable, but not enough in itself. So what now? Now we have to work. We must learn to look, to remain slightly apart from the world, sitting just like this with closed eyes. We must learn to allow the tumult to settle.</p><p>The first thing to accomplish is no more than that, sitting still and quiet for long enough to allow a kind of calm to settle around the chatter of our mind, enough for us to start seeing a bit more clearly. We must not try to achieve it by force or will&#x2014;that would only trigger more chaos. We must let it happen, let it come, from inside.</p><p>We have gone inside ourselves, for real. Our inner world was close by, but we never went there.</p><p>Sometimes we have to wait a long time. This process is not something that can be rushed. We would like to speed it up, but no, meditation takes time. In fact there are days when nothing comes at all. Which may come as a bit of a shock, and seem out of tune with times that promise us instant, guaranteed results. Zen wisdom has many tales to illustrate this point, such as the one about a student who asks his teacher, &#x201c;Master, how long will I have to meditate to attain serenity?&#x201d; After a long silence the master replies, &#x201c;Thirty years.&#x201d; The student looks stricken. &#x201c;Er&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that&#x2019;s a very long time. What if I make twice the effort? What if I work really hard, day and night, and don&#x2019;t do anything else?&#x201d; The teacher remains silent for a very long time and then says, &#x201c;Then it will take you fifty years.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Starting to see more clearly</p><p>So we have stopped, we have sat down and closed our eyes. Not to sleep, not to rest, but to understand. We need to understand what we feel and put some order into the chaos that is simply the world&#x2019;s echo within ourselves. We must understand that there are two paths: the path of intelligence (acting, intervening, kneading reality with our will, lucidity and effort) and the path of experience (welcoming naked reality and allowing it to cover, inhabit and imbue us, in a movement of intensely attentive letting go).</p><p>Both intelligence and experience keep us in contact with the world, one enabling us to understand it better, the other to feel it better. Each in its own way is a perfect path. Neither is superior to the other. We need them both, and we must keep both alive and in working order.</p><p>To put it more simply, we can say that the first path is that of philosophical thought, while the second (receiving the world without necessarily understanding it, or understanding it but without words, or beyond words) is that of mindfulness. It is the meditative approach of mindfulness that is the subject of this book.</p><p>Living in mindfulness</p><p>Mindfulness means intensifying our presence to the moment, stilling ourselves to absorb it, instead of escaping it or trying to alter it, through thought or action.</p><p>There is mindfulness in the action of the philosopher who turns for a moment from his work of thinking and enters a different mode of being, digesting and assimilating all that his intelligence has just produced or discovered, preparing himself, perhaps, to go further still, and pausing to be aware.</p><p>So mindfulness is not about creating emptiness, nor is it about producing thoughts. It means stopping to make contact with the ever-shifting experience that we are having at the time, and to observe the nature of our relationship to that experience, the nature of our presence at that moment.</p><p>This is what is happening now if, while continuing to read these words attentively, you realize that you are also breathing and having bodily sensations, that there are other objects in your field of vision besides this book, that there are sounds around you, that there are thoughts calling you away or murmuring assessments and judgments of what you are reading, and so on.</p><p>Mindfulness means, just as you are about to turn this page and move on to the next (perhaps your hand is already poised, before you even finish reading these lines), halting your movement and observing, for example, the intention to turn the page that&#x2019;s already within you. Saying to yourself, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to turn the page,&#x201d; rather than doing it without even noticing. Mindfulness means making a tiny space every now and then to see ourselves doing something. You will tell me we don&#x2019;t need to do this in order to turn a page. And that is true. On the other hand, it may prove useful at many other times in our lives.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1.</p><p>BECOMING AWARE:</p><p>AN ATTITUDE OF MIND</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><i>The Magpie</i>, Claude Monet <i>(1840&#x2013;1926)</i></p><p>1868&#x2013;1869, oil on canvas, 89 x 130 cm, Mus�e d&#x2019;Orsay, Paris</p><p>To make a perfect winter day like this, you must have a clear, sparkling air, with a sheen from the snow, sufficient cold, little or no wind; and the warmth must come directly from the sun.

In a little while it will be something else&#x2014;the magpie will have flown away, the sun will be higher in the sky, the shadow of the hedge will have retreated. It won&#x2019;t be better, or not as good, it will just be different. So now is the time to stop walking, feel the cold air sting our nostrils, listen to all the muffled sounds and admire the extraordinary light of sun on snow. We must stay here as long as we can, not waiting for anything in particular&#x2014;quite the opposite! Just stay here, doing our best to perceive the countless riches of this moment: the clumps of snow that fall from the trees with a tiny, soft thud; the blue-white shadow of the hedge; the small movements of a magpie seeking a little warmth in the sun. Everything is perfect. Nothing more is needed for this moment to feel complete.</p><p>With mindfulness we can simply be present to this ordinary moment of light and grace.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Decide to inhabit the present moment</p><p>Mindfulness teaches us to open our eyes. It is important to do this because, here and now, there are worlds around us that we constantly ignore. We can enter them by interrupting the automatic flow of our actions and thoughts.</p><p>It&#x2019;s true that access to these worlds of the present moment is made easier by external gifts, such as the sun, snow and magpie of Monet&#x2019;s painting. But it also requires a decision on our part to open ourselves up as often as we can to being touched, contacted and struck by life. This is an act of deliberate awareness. We must decide to open our mind&#x2019;s door to all that lies beyond it, rather than hiding away in one of our inner fortresses, such as rumination, reflection, certainty or expectation.</p><p>Mindfulness is also liberating. It frees us from thoughts of the future or past, because it pulls us back into the present. And it liberates us from our value judgments, because it pulls us back into presence. Our minds are cluttered with so many things! Some are important, some are interesting, and some are completely pointless and futile. These pointless things hinder our vision and connection with the world. We need the past and the future, our memories and projects, but we also need the present. Both past and future matter. The philosophy of the present moment doesn&#x2019;t see it as <i>better</i> than the past or future, just more fragile. It is the present that we must protect, because it vanishes from our awareness whenever we are rushed or busy. We must give the present the space in which to exist.</p><p>Feel instead of thinking:<br>Immersive awareness</p><p>Mindfulness meditation isn&#x2019;t about <i>analyzing</i> the present moment, or at least not in the way people sometimes imagine. It&#x2019;s about feeling it, sensing it, with our whole body, without words. It is neither usual nor comfortable for us to do without language over a sustained period as we go through certain moments of our lives. Nor is it easy. Not talking is one thing, but not <i>thinking</i>! Just feeling and connecting. And yet all of us have already had this experience. What happens at such times goes beyond words and is very precisely described in the following extract from <i>The Letter of Lord Chandos</i>, a magnificent short story by Austrian writer Hugo von Hofmannsthal: &#x201c;Since then I have led an existence which I fear you could hardly imagine, so inanely, so unconsciously has it been proceeding.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It will not be easy for me to convey the substance of these good moments to you; words fail me once again at such times, filling any mundane object around me with a swelling tide of higher life as if it were a vessel, in fact it has no name and is no doubt hardly nameable. I cannot expect you to understand me without an illustration, and I must ask you to forgive the silliness of my examples. A watering can, a harrow left in a field, a dog in the sun, a shabby churchyard, a cripple, a small farmhouse&#x2014;any of these can become the vessel of my revelation.

Here Dr. Lewis-Williams and David Pearce examine the intricate web of belief, myth, and society in the succeeding Neolithic period, arguably the most significant turning point in all human history, when agriculture became a way of life and the fractious society that we know today was born.<br><br> The authors focus on two contrasting times and places: the beginnings in the Near East, with its mud-brick and stone houses each piled on top of the ruins of another, and western Europe, with its massive stone monuments more ancient than the Egyptian pyramids.<br><br> They argue that neurological patterns hardwired into the brain help explain the art and society that Neolithic people produced. Drawing on the latest research, the authors skillfully link material on human consciousness, imagery, and religious concepts to propose provocative new theories about the causes of an ancient revolution in cosmology and the origins of social complexity. In doing so they create a fascinating neurological bridge to the mysterious thought-lives of the past and reveal the essence of a momentous period in human history. 100 illustrations, 20 in color.</p><p><p><strong>David Lewis-Williams</strong> is Professor Emeritus and Senior Mentor at the Rock Art Research Institute, University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.

Building one will appeal to bakers, builders, and beginners of all kinds, from:<br> <li>the serious or aspiring baker who wants the best low-cost bread oven, to</li><br> <li>gardeners who want a centerpiece for a beautiful outdoor kitchen, to</li><br> <li>outdoor chefs, to</li><br> <li>creative people interested in low-cost materials and simple technology, to</li><br> <li>teachers who want a multi-faceted, experiential project for students of all ages (the book has been successful with everyone from third-graders to adults).<br> <i>Build Your Own Earth Oven</i> is fully illustrated with step-by-step directions, including how to tend the fire, and how to make perfect sourdough hearth loaves in the artisan tradition. The average do-it-yourselfer with a few tools and a scrap pile can build an oven for free, or close to it. Otherwise, $30 should cover all your materials--less than the price of a fancy "baking stone." Good building soil is often right in your back yard, under your feet. Build the simplest oven in a day! With a bit more time and imagination, you can make a permanent foundation and a fire-breathing dragon-oven or any other shape you can dream up.<br> Earth ovens are familiar to many that have seen a southwestern "horno" or a European "bee-hive" oven. The idea (pioneered by Egyptian bakers in the second millennium bc!) is simplicity itself: fill the oven with wood, light a fire, and let it burn down to ashes. The dense, 3- to 12-inch-thick earthen walls hold and store the heat of the fire, the baker sweeps the floor clean, and the hot oven walls radiate steady, intense heat for hours.<br> Home bakers who can't afford a fancy, steam-injected bread oven will be delighted to find that a simple earth oven can produce loaves to equal the fanciest "artisan" bakery. It also makes delicious roast meats, cakes, pies, pizzas, and other creations. Pizza cooks to perfection in three minutes or less. Vegetables, herbs, and potatoes drizzled with olive oil roast up in minutes for a simple, elegant, and delicious meal. Efficient cooks will find the residual heat useful for slow-baked dishes, and even for drying surplus produce, or incubating homemade yogurt.</li></p><p><p>Kiko Denzer is an artist, teacher, and author in the earthen building revival. He serves as artist-in-residence in schools in his home state of Oregon, and has muddied tens of thousands of hands with his popular oven and bread manual, <em>Build Your Own Earth Oven </em>(2007) as well as his guide to mud-based art forms, <em>Dig Your Hands in the Dirt</em> (2005).</p>INTRODUCTION Why a wood-fired, earthen oven? <p>Modern cookbooks make bread-baking seem complicated and difficult &#x2014; which it is not. Building and baking in a wood-fired earthen oven restores the simplicity of bread by returning you to essentials: earth, water, air, and fire. </p><p>Plants transform the energy of the sun into woody material, fire transforms wood into energy, and the massive walls of an earthen oven absorb and concentrate that energy as heat. After a couple of hours, the oven is hot enough that you can remove the fire and bake bread. The hot, dense mud radiates its stored heat at a steady rate (like the sun!) </p><p>Radiant heat is fundamental to our very existence &#x2014; from it we have photosynthesis and weather, food and shelter, and sunny days on the beach, not to mention wheat and bread. The architect Christopher Alexander says that humans have a biologically built-in human preference for radiant heat &#x2014; his answer to why people prefer an open fireplace to an open heating vent. Perhaps that&#x2019;s another reason why bread is better baked in a wood-fired oven.... </p><p>Radiation is one of three ways that heat can be transferred from oven to bread: the other two are convection and conduction. Convection is the reason why warm air rises &#x2014; heated air molecules move faster &#x2014; the faster they move, the farther apart they get and the fewer of them there are in a given amount of space. Fewer molecules have less weight, making hot air lighter than cold air; thus, hot air rises. Convection works in any gas or liquid, but it doesn&#x2019;t work in solid materials, like brick or metal. So heat doesn&#x2019;t always rise, or at least, not exclusively. In a solid material, heat moves in all directions, by a method called conduction. Conduction is how a hot frying pan cooks an egg &#x2014; direct contact with hot metal transfers heat very quickly to the egg, which cooks much faster than it would if it was only in contact with hot air. </p><p>Modern ovens depend primarily on convection, so it&#x2019;s not the oven that does the cooking; instead, the air carries the heat to your bread, and the bread cooks. Even if a modern oven has no hot or cold spots, baking more than two loaves requires careful arrangement so the air can carry equal amounts of heat to every loaf. Fancy, so-called "convection" ovens try to improve the situation with a fan that hurries the hot air around. Special baking pans or stones can help improve your bread, but they are poor substitutes for the original oven, which was made of earth. </p><p>An earthen oven bakes your bread using all three kinds of heat transfer: radiant heat from the hot walls; conducted heat from hot bricks through the bottom of the loaf, and convected heat from hot, steamy air swirling inside the sealed oven. With all this heat from every direction, many loaves cook as easily as one. In addition, the different kinds of heat working together improve what is called "oven spring" &#x2014; the irregular air holes and high loaf that happen when a vigorous batch of yeasty dough gives a final surge of activity in response to a hot floor and hot, steamy air. In addition, superheated steam caramelizes the sugars in the outside layer of dough, producing a lovely, crisp, substantial crust. </p><p>Building and baking with a wood-fired earthen oven not only makes wonderful bread, it can also teach you things you&#x2019;ll never learn with a modern oven, bread machine, or book. Instead of turning switches, you will come to know earth, air, fire and water, and you will come to know the life they give to grain and yeast and bread, as well as the life they give to us. Books can explain why, but the best way to really understand is to do it yourself. "You got to go there to know there." </p><p>Earthen Building, or what is "cob," anyway? </p><p>Earth is the most common, and perhaps the most versatile building material on the planet. Mixed with sand and straw, a clay subsoil will become very hard and durable; indeed, it was the first, natural "concrete." In the Americas, this material is called "adobe," from an Arabic word, al-toba, meaning "the brick." Invading Moors brought the word to Spain from North Africa, where the ancient tradition of mud building continues today. In Britain, the continuing tradition of earthen building is called cob, from an old English word meaning "lump." The Brits skipped the step of forming bricks, and made their walls by packing wet blobs of mud on top of each other, letting them dry, and carving them smooth. Five-hundred-year-old cob houses are common in Devon, England, where they are recognized on historic registers, and command high prices when sold. </p><p>Protected by roof and foundation from direct rain and snow, earthen buildings hold up very well, even in damp, windy Devon. I built a mud studio in the temperate rainforest of the Oregon coast range, and it is warmer and drier than my wooden cabin &#x2014; not to mention that it&#x2019;s impervious to fire, and the bugs that eat wood can&#x2019;t stomach it. </p><p>Building a mud oven is like building a mud house, on a smaller scale. The dome shape is basic in nature, common to beehives, bird&#x2019;s nests, caves, cliff dwellings, igloos, huts, and the Houston Astrodome &#x2014; strong, self-supporting, easy to build and heat.</p></p><h2>The Mabinogion</h2><p>Closely linked to the Arthurian legends - King Arthur himself appears in one of the stories - they summon up a world of mystery and magic which is still evoked by the landscape so vividly described in them.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.Preface by John Updike <br>The 11 stories of "The Mabinogion, first assembled on paper in the fourteenth century, reach far back into the earlier oral traditions of Welsh poetry. <br>Closely linked to the Arthurian legends--King Arthur himself is a character--they summon up a world of mystery and magic that is still evoked by the Welsh landscape they so vividly describe. Mingling fantasy with tales of chivalry, these stories not only prefigure the later medieval romances, but stand on their own as magnificent evocations of a golden age of Celtic civilization. <br>This translation of "The Mabinogion has, since its first appearance in 1949, been recognized as a classic in its own right. It was last revised by Gwyn Jones and his wife, Mair, in 1993.</p><h2>Andrew Wyeth: Autobiography</h2><p>The most comprehensive edition of the artist&#39;s work ever published reproduces 138 paintings, including Wyeth&#39;s most recognized works, along with his comments about each one and reflections on his life. National ad/promo. BOMC selection.</p><p>Andrew Wyeth is perhaps the most popular American artist of the twentieth century. He has been the subject of numerous major exhibitions, including ones at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; and Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco. Many books have been published on his art. <br><br>Thomas Hoving, the former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the former editor-in-chief of Connoisseur, is a cultural affairs consultant and the author of many books, including Making the Mummies Dance, his recent bestselling memoirs. A new book about art fakes will be published shortly.<br>Here, the legendary American realist painter looks back at six decades of his work. This comprehensive retrospective that originated in Japan and is now on view in Kansas City, Missouri, includes both famous and recent paintings. An artistic independent, Wyeth pictures a different view of reality than does, say, Norman Rockwell. Thomas Hoving introduces the book and observes that Wyeth "has always painted for himself." Thus, Wyeth's comments on the origins and events of each painting are of particular interest. The quality of the printing is very good, avoiding the pitfalls of too much high contrast and loss of shadow detail in the pictures. But best of all are the stories Wyeth tells. Sure to appeal to both general and informed readers, this is recommended for the autobiography and art collections of public and academic libraries.?Andy Murphy, Charleston P.L., S.C.<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cream Puff Murder (Hannah Swensen Mystery)</h2><p>Bakery owner Hannah Swensen has a dress to fit into and a date with her sister, Andrea, at Lake Eden&#39;s new health club, Heavenly Bodies.

Hundreds of thousands of terrified Greek and Armenian refugees fled to Smyrna as Mustapha Kemal (known today as Ataturk) and his Moslem army advanced on the mostly Christian city.

Shaw stared at him from ruthless gray eyes, his lean, powerful body coiled behind a stone-and-glass desk, like a silent predator stalking unsuspecting prey.<br><br>Harry wondered if the rumors he'd heard were true. Was he alone with a brutal killer? Someone who'd, literally, gotten away with murder?<br><br>Harry's blood felt like ice in his veins, despite the heat of the April sun streaming through a wall of windows. He was standing on the top floor of the newest, and by far grandest, Shaw Tower, a combination hotel, condominium and office building in downtown Houston, Texas. From his vertigo-inducing perch, Harry could see the far-reaching geographic boundaries of the city, nearly forty miles away.<br><br>It was hard to believe how much of that real estate was controlled by the indecently wealthy man sitting before him. Was it so wrong to want a little piece of that pie for himself? This was Harry's first venture into extortion, and he was a little nervous. But he was certain Shaw would pay&#x2014;and pay well&#x2014;to learn the tantalizing secret he'd come here to sell.<br><br>Harry tried to meet Shaw's piercing gaze as he made his demand for cash, but he couldn't quite raise his eyes that last six inches. He focused instead on the crisp collar of Shaw's white shirt, the smooth knot of his patterned blue silk tie and the lapels of his dark blue blended wool suit, as he said, "I have information of vital interest to you."<br><br>"I'm listening," Shaw said.<br><br>Harry saw a flicker of movement over his shoulder and realized they were no longer alone in Shaw's office on the Tower's 80th floor. He started as a man two or three inches taller than Wyatt's reputed 6'4", and maybe fifty pounds heavier, stepped into his line of sight.<br><br>"You wanted me, Boss?" the man said, speaking to Shaw as though Harry wasn't there.<br><br>Harry wondered how the gargantuan man in a cheap brown suit&#x2014;who reminded him of the enforcers he'd seen in Mafia movies&#x2014;had been summoned and realized Shaw must have hit some button on his desk. He thought back to the female secretary in the outer office. The older, benign-looking lady in a skirt that fell two inches below her knees and sensible pumps had made him feel perfectly safe coming into what he could now see was a cage of steel and glass from which there was no escape.<br><br>Harry licked at the sweat above his lip, recognized it for the anxious gesture it was and stiffened his spine. He was the best at what he did precisely because he didn't allow himself to be intimidated.<br><br>Nevertheless, he felt his bowels shift in an instinctive animal response to mortal danger.<br><br>"I'll be with you in a minute," Shaw said to the big man he'd summoned. Then he fixed his steely gaze on Harry. "You were saying?"<br><br>Harry watched as the big man guarding the door, who had an ugly scar on his cheek and a crooked, many-times-broken nose, took a pose that reminded him of a military man "at ease," his meaty hands behind his back, his tree-trunk legs spread wide. The enforcer's dark eyes, under heavy black brows, stayed focused on Harry as though he were some lower form of life, a bug this big man would like to squash.<br><br>Harry mentally shook his head. He was anticipating trouble where there might be none. Shaw had done nothing overtly threatening. It was the information Harry had dug up on the man sitting across from him that was scaring him shitless.<br><br>Harry fought the urge to turn tail and run. He chided himself again for letting his imagination run wild. Surely Shaw would be grateful to hear what Harry had discovered, even if he was also shocked by the revelation.<br><br>"I want your agreement to pay before I tell you what I know."<br><br>Harry waited for Shaw to ask what it was or how much he wanted or refuse to pay or say <em>something </em>that would give him an idea where to go from there. He'd never suspected, when Governor Pendleton had hired him to hunt down the biological father of her daughter-in-law's twin sons, that his search would lead him to this enigmatic man.<br><br>He'd brought a picture of Lucky and Chance, in case Shaw asked to see them. The boys had blue eyes and black hair like their mother, Kate Pendleton. And were long and lanky, with square chins, strong noses and high cheekbones like their father, Wyatt Shaw.<br><br>Harry hadn't believed his luck when he'd finally stumbled on the truth. The governor had mentioned a reunion her son and Kate had attended in Austin at the Four Seasons. The trip would have been around the time of the twins' conception, nine years ago. Shaw hadn't been as well-known then, but the brand-new receptionist at the hotel, who'd taken his American Express card at the Austin, Texas, Four Seasons that fateful night, had become the current manager of the hotel.<br><br>The incident had remained fixed in her mind because it was the first of the new Centurion Cards&#x2014;a black AMEX card with supposedly unlimited credit&#x2014; she'd ever seen, and it had been handed to her by an extraordinarily good-looking young man with silver wings in his black hair.<br><br>The manager told him that when she'd recognized Wyatt Shaw with his infamous father on TV less than a year later, she'd marveled at how close she'd come to flirting with a dangerous criminal. She'd admitted to being jealous, that long-ago evening, of the strikingly beautiful woman holding the handsome man's hand.<br><br>And yes, she'd confirmed, the lady in the photo Harry had shown her was the same woman Wyatt Shaw had taken with him on the elevator to the penthouse suite he'd booked.<br><br>Harry had quickly realized he'd stumbled onto a gold mine. He could get paid again and again to keep his mouth shut about the information he'd discovered: Mob Boss Dante D'Amato's bastard son, Wyatt Shaw, was the father of Texas Governor Ann Wade Pendleton's grandsons.<br><br>Governor Pendleton, who'd hired him, would pay, of course. He could also sell his willing silence to the twins' very wealthy great-grandfathers, who'd probably fork over a hunk of money to keep the world from knowing who their granddaughter had screwed while she'd been married to another man.<br><br>Jackson Blackthorne, Kate Pendleton's paternal grandfather, owned a ranch the size of Vermont in South Texas called Bitter Creek. Kate's maternal grandfather, King Grayhawk, owned an equally impressive ranch called Kingdom Come in Wyoming, where he served as that state's governor. The two men were lifelong enemies, a fact Harry was sure he could use to his advantage.<br><br>The mind boggled at what the tabloids might pay for such juicy gossip.<br><br>In the end, Harry had decided that the man who stood to gain the most&#x2014;the knowledge that he had eight-year-old twin sons&#x2014;was the man who'd be willing to pay the most. So even before he told Governor Pendleton what he knew, or approached either of Kate's influential grandfathers, or phoned the first tabloid magazine, he'd come here to confront Shaw.<br><br>Considering the menacing man standing just inside the door, and the even more dangerous one sitting behind the desk, Harry knew he was walking a tightrope over an abyss.<br><br>Greed gave him the courage to take the next step.<br><br>Harry glanced at the hulking figure by the door, and said, "I want half a million."<br><br>The demand was met by silence.<br><br>Harry struggled not to fidget while he waited for Shaw to speak. He'd thought long and hard about how much he could ask Shaw to pay. He'd dreamed of a million, but realized if he got half of that, with what he'd already saved, he could buy a small fishing boat and a condo on the gulf near Corpus Christi and be set for the rest of his life. With a net worth over half a billion, half a million was a drop in the bucket for Shaw.<br><br>"I'm sure whatever it is you think you know isn't worth that kind of money," Shaw replied at last.<br><br>"This information has nothing to do with your... uh... business activities." Harry had nearly said <em>illegal </em>business activities. The U.S. Justice Department had been unable to prove Shaw had ill-gotten gains under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, although they'd taken him to court at least once to try. And the Houston cops hadn't yet found enough evidence&#x2014;despite the woman found strangled in Shaw's bed six weeks ago&#x2014;to charge him with murder.<br><br>Wyatt Shaw seemed to walk between raindrops.<br><br>But Harry knew the rich man's life hadn't always been so blessed.<br><br>His mother had been Dante D'Amato's mistress until her death, under suspicious circumstances, when Shaw was twelve. The child born on the wrong side of the blanket, so to speak, had succeeded so spectacularly that the government&#x2014;read FBI&#x2014;refused to believe he'd done it without help from the mob.<br><br>Harry was pretty sure the Feds monitored every dollar in and out of Shaw's many business activities, looking for enough evidence to bring down his empire. Which only convinced Harry that Shaw would know how to pay him the half mil without raising any red flags for the IRS.<br><br>"Has to be a woman," Shaw said in disgust. "What is she claiming?"<br><br>Harry had expected the dismissive look on Shaw's face. The man had never been married and didn't have a steady girlfriend, though there was no shortage of women in his life. Harry had discovered from a lady lawyer Shaw briefly dated that he always took precautions to ensure there was no unwanted child.<br><br>Which made Harry wonder if the dead woman found in Shaw's penthouse suite might have been pregnant. And trying to extort money from Shaw. As he was.<br><br>Harry shuddered. The medical examiner's report on the murder victim hadn't been released to the public yet, and Harry's usual connection in the M.E.'s office had been too spooked to leak it to him. Which meant anything was possible.<br><br>Harry's investigation also revealed that Shaw usually bedded his dates in his&#x2014;now infamous&#x2014;penthouse at the Shaw Tower, or an equivalent locale. Not one of them had been to his personal retreat, a ranch compound north of Houston.<br><br>Ancient live oaks, which never completely shed their leaves, kept the structures within Shaw's compound hidden from Google Earth. But from county records, Harry knew Shaw had built a modest, four-bedroom home, stables large enough to hold a dozen sleek quarter horses and on-site housing, a sort of bunkhouse, for his security team. To guarantee his privacy, Shaw had surrounded the compound with eight-foot-high river-rock walls.<br><br>His isolated compound&#x2014;and his isolated lifestyle&#x2014; made a powerful statement: Shaw lived a life without strings, a life without human connections. So Harry expected him to resist the idea that he had twin sons, maybe even to dismiss Harry's suggestion as ridiculous.<br><br>Luckily, Harry had proof. DNA results made it 99.9 percent certain that Shaw was the twins' father.<br><br>"Who sent you here?" Shaw asked.<br><br>"I want your promise to pay before I say anything more."<br><br>"You'd take my word?" Shaw said cynically, lifting a brow.<br><br>Harry shrugged. "You have a reputation for sticking by it in business deals." Which this was. Sort of.<br><br>"Bruce, escort this man from the premises."<br><br>"Wait!" Harry reached into his jacket and found his wrist handcuffed by Bruce's gigantic hand. How had the big man moved so fast? "I don't have a weapon," Harry babbled, afraid the monster was going to crush his bones. "There are papers in my jacket. And a photo."<br><br>"Let him go," Shaw said.<br><br>With a shaking hand, Harry pulled out the papers he'd been reaching for, which had been folded in his suit coat pocket. They rustled as he unfolded them and took the few steps forward to lay them on Shaw's desk.<br><br>Shaw spread the papers apart and stared at them, his brow furrowed. "This looks like&#x2014;"<br><br>"It's the results of a DNA test," Harry interrupted. "You can see that the first chart matches the second two almost exactly."<br><br>"The second <em>two?"</em><br><br>"You have twin eight-year-old sons," Harry blurted.<br><br>Shaw's brows arrowed down and his lips pressed flat.<br><br>Harry was afraid to breathe, waiting for Shaw to deny paternity despite the DNA results. He expected the businessman to ask how Harry had gotten his DNA. It had been easy, since the man ate most of his meals in restaurants. A fork he'd eaten from, a glass he'd drunk from, was all Harry had needed.<br><br>Instead, Shaw said, "Who's the mother?"<br><br>Harry licked his lips. "Half a million."<br><br>Shaw nodded curtly.<br><br>"Her name is Kate Grayhawk Pendleton. She's the governor's daughter-in-law. She lives in San Antonio." He laid a 4"x6" photograph beside the DNA results on the table. It showed the smiling mother standing between her identical grinning sons, one slender arm resting on each boy's narrow shoulder.<br><br>Harry watched several emotions flicker in Wyatt Shaw's narrowed gaze, none of which were pleasant. The expected shock. Anger. Disgust. And then, a great deal more anger.<br><br>"Her husband?" Shaw asked.<br><br>"She was widowed eighteen months ago. Her husband died serving in Afghanistan."<br><br>Harry was glad for the husband's sake that he was dead. And he wouldn't have wanted to be in the woman's shoes when Shaw caught up to her. For half a million, he figured he owed Shaw a heads-up on the woman's current situation. After all, the businessman had been back and forth to China a dozen times over the past six months and might not have kept up with the local news.<br><br>"Mrs. Pendleton was shot last October by that assassin trying to kill the governor. She was in a coma for four months and spent about six weeks in a rehab facility. She seems to have come out of it just fine. She went home ten days ago."<br><br>"Tell my secretary where you want the money wired," Shaw said through tight jaws.<br><br>Harry couldn't believe it had been that easy. Couldn't believe Shaw was actually going to pay.<br><br>Then he saw Shaw's glance slide to Bruce, watched his chin drop the littlest bit, sending some kind of message to the big man. Harry felt the sudden urge to run. For a moment he was frozen, like a frightened rabbit, panting for breath.<br><br>Then he made his move.<br><br>His eyes darted from Shaw to the big man as he hurriedly backed his way out of the office, leaving the test results and the photograph on the glass in front of Shaw, letting the heavy wooden door slide silently closed behind him. He glanced over his shoulder, alarmed to see Bruce pass through the same door a few seconds later.<br><br>Harry paused at the secretary's desk long enough to say, "I'll give you a call and let you know where to wire the money."<br><br>She didn't ask "What money?" She must be used to business deals made on a handshake. Or in this case, a chin nod.<br><br></p><h2>Mandie&#39;s Cookbook (Mandie Books)</h2><p>Introduces recipes for dishes as they were prepared at the turn of the century, including corn pudding and southern fried chicken, through the story of Mandie learning cooking from her Aunt Lou.</p><p><b>Lois Gladys Leppard</b> is the ever-popular and prolific writer of the MANDIE� BOOKS.

Curly knobs, tiny plaits, intricate weaves. Dreads are a modern phenomena with roots that reach as far back as the fifth century. According to ancient Hindu beliefs, dreadlocks signified a singleminded pursuit of the spiritual. Devotion to God displaced vanity, and hair was left to its own devices. In the West, locks are a relatively recent fashion, born of the Black Power movement of the sixties and the infiltration of reggae into popular music.<p> In <i>Dreads</i>, photographers Francesco Mastalia and Alfonse Pagano capture the rebels of this natural hair revolution in all their beautiful, subversive glory. One hundred duotone portraits present dread-heads from all walks of life: a Brooklyn postal worker, a Japanese farmer, an Indian sadhu, a Jamaican drummer. Interviewed on location by the photographers, jatta-wearers from around the world wax philosophic about the integrity of their hair, and every stunning image confirms their choice. In her introduction, Alice Walker offers lyrical ruminations about her decision to let her own mane mat.</p><p> Today, trendsetters in Tokyo pay thousands of yen to have their poker-straight hair literally drilled into locks. The fact that the young and hip now go to such extremes to imitate what was originally a statement against artificiality proves the growing popularity of dreads.

Braving the treacherous desert climate on a trek fraught with danger at every turning, guided only by a crumbling map, the Emersons are unaware that deception is leading them onward into a nest of vipers -- where a dreadful fate may await. For young Ramses, forced to keep his growing love for the beautiful Nefret secret, temptation along the way may prove his ultimate undoing. And a dark past and grim obligation have ensnared Nefret once again, as she is helpless to save those she loves most from the prison of the Lost Oasis.</p><p><em>Guardian of the Horizon</em> is rich with suspense, surprises, unforgettable characters, and the intoxicating atmosphere that has earned its author the coveted title of Grand Master two times over.

According to Merasen, the brother of the ruling monarch, their old friend Prince Tarek is in grave danger and needs their help, however it's not until they retrace their steps back to the Oasis, with its strange mixture of Meroitic and Egyptian cultures, that they learn the real reason for their journey. There's no better company on an archaeological expedition than the Father of Curses and the Lady Doctor, their beautiful Anglo-Egyptian ward, and Ramses, the Demon Brother who loves her, as Peters once again demonstrates in the latest historical mystery in this immensely popular series.

Here is Ross Macdonald's masterful tale of buried memories, the consequences of arrogance, and the anguished relations between parents and their children. Riveting, gritty, tautly written, <b>Sleeping Beauty</b> is crime fiction at its best.<br><br>If any writer can be said to have inherited the mantle of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, it is Ross Macdonald. Between the late 1940s and his death in 1983, he gave the American crime novel a psychological depth and moral complexity that his pre-decessors had only hinted at. And in the character of Lew Archer, Macdonald redefined the private eye as a roving conscience who walks the treacherous frontier between criminal guilt and human sin."Ross Macdonald is either part or wholly wizard. . .conjuring the magic of real mystery. . . . A masterpiece." --Chicago Tribune Book World<br><br>"Sleeping Beauty is particularly complex and satisfactory. . . . It is a marvelous formula that Macdonald has found; the wonder is that he keeps improving it." --Newsweek<br><br>"Ross Macdonald remains the grandmaster, taking the crime novel to new heights by imbuing it with psychological resonance, complexity of story, and richness of style that remain inspiring." --Jonathan Kellerman</p><h2>Justice for All: Earl Warren and the Nation He Made</h2><p>An account of the career of the former chief justice and chairman of the Warren Commission draws on previously unavailable government documents and new interviews to evaluate his integral roles in the evolutions of defining political moments from the past half century, from school desegregation to the support of Japanese Americans interred during World War II. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>James S. Newton has written hundreds of newspaper and magazine stories and is the recipient of numerous awards. He shared in the Pulitzer prizes awarded to the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> for coverage of the 1992 riots and the 1994 Northridge earthquake.Earl Warren was the most important twentieth century American politician not to achieve the presidency. He spawned a couple of good biographies in the 1960s, a very good one in the 1990s, but now with Jim Newton's <i>Justice for All: Earl Warren and the Nation He Made</i> there is a biography that captures the man and his career in full. <br><br> <i>Justice for All</i> is very sensibly organized. The first quarter of the book takes Warren from birth through his initial political offices, district attorney and state attorney general. The second quarter treats the gubernatorial years of the most popular governor in California history (and losing vice-presidential candidate in 1948 as well as an unsuccessful presidential aspirant four years later). Then the final half of the book deals with the culmination of his career -- Chief Justice of the most controversial Supreme Court in American history. In each part, Newton successfully weaves Warren the family man, Warren the boss, and Warren the politician into the narrative. He was a great husband and father, a demanding boss, a thin-skinned (are there any other kind?) but extraordinarily astute (if not cerebral) politician. <br><br> Warren was a life-long Republican, but one coming out of the Progressive tradition of California Senator Hiram Johnson. Essentially, he was a non-partisan partisan. At the time California allowed candidates to cross-list and run in both primaries. Going for governor in 1942 Warren did and almost won the Democratic nomination. Seeking reelection in 1946, he did win the Democratic primary and handily swept his own party's. As governor he tried to get the best people into the correct jobs regardless of their politics and then protect them as long as they did their jobs well. Throughout Warren radiated integrity. <br><br> As a non-partisan, he took a quick -- and lifelong -- dislike to Richard Nixon (who was anxious for an endorsement that was never forthcoming). Nixon more than got even. He was the Californian who won at the 1952 Republican Convention (thanks to his underhanded dealings) and he, not Lyndon Johnson, picked Warren's successor. But Warren lived just long enough to be told that the Court had ruled against Nixon in the Watergate Tapes Case. <br><br> Warren made mistakes at every stage of his career. His handling of the Point Lobos murders was the type of prosecutorial and police conduct that he would later condemn on the Court (and he bristled at suggestions that the convicted men were innocent). He was actively involved in the forced relocation of Japanese Americans during World War II (the biggest blight on his career -- FDR's too). He might have handled charges of communism at Berkeley better. But he grew in each job as Newton adroitly demonstrates, and the proof was in his final one. <br><br> In his first year as Chief Justice he wrote the unanimous opinion in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) holding segregated schools were unconstitutional. He was instrumental in the previously split Court's ability to achieve unanimity. Brown is such a great result that Warren's place in the Court's history was made at the beginning. But he was destined to make a lot more history. A decade after Brown he wrote the opinions that held "one person, one vote" was required in both chambers of a state legislature. He believed passionately in the efficacy of the vote and thought that ending rotten boroughs would produce better legislative results. Two years later he authored Miranda v. Arizona (1966) for a 5-4 Court. Warren believed he was assisting the police to become more professional and was just giving the less fortunate the knowledge that more affluent Americans already had. Coming as it did amidst increasing crime (as the baby-boomers reached the age of criminality) and summer race riots, those justifications were ignored, and there was a huge backlash against Miranda -- ironically one that helped propel Nixon to the White House. <br><br> Despite the controversial legacy of the Warren Court, it is hard to imagine people believing that segregation should be lawful wherever whites wished it to be or that rotten boroughs should enjoy disproportionate political representation or that police should exercise their discretion without any serious supervision. Even the Warren Court's obscenity decisions (which Warren objected to) are tame, very tame, by today's standards. It will be a long, long time before someone writes a better biography of Earl Warren than Jim Newton has. Newton's choices for the Court years are judicious and show a sure hand in understanding what was important and what was not. For anyone with an interest in either twentieth century American history or the US Supreme Court, <i>Justice for All</i> is a must. -- <i>Lucas A. Powe, <i>Book of the Month Club</i></i><br><br>On my office wall hangs a faded leaflet I picked up on a Dallas street the day John F. Kennedy was shot. It shows two police-booking-style photos of the president, beneath which blares the line "Wanted for Treason" and the accusations that he aided "Communist inspired racial riots" and "illegally invaded a sovereign state" when he sent U.S. troops to quell a riot that greeted a black student's entrance to the University of Mississippi in 1962. <p>Just weeks before Kennedy's 1963 murder, Ku Klux Klan bombers killed four girls in a church in Birmingham, Ala. Earlier, civil rights leader Medgar Evers was assassinated in Mississippi, and Gov. George Wallace defied court orders to integrate the University of Alabama. Segregationist Southerners blamed Kennedy and the allegedly Communist-backed Martin Luther King for all of it. </p><p>But the man behind the destruction of the century-old Southern system of racial segregation was not Kennedy or any Democrat at all. That man was Earl Warren, the former Republican governor of California who was appointed chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court by a Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower. By the late '60s, the solidly Democratic South had defected to the GOP because of Democratic support for civil rights legislation sparked by the Warren court's decisions. </p><p>A further irony is that Warren was an almost stereotypical Republican before joining the high court. As Jim Newton reveals in his meticulously researched and well-told new biography, "Justice for All," Warren was a zealous prosecutor, passionately anti-Communist, pro-business, anti-New Deal, anti-gambling, anti-pornography, tough on crime (his father was murdered in their Bakersfield home in 1938), and he favored interning California's Japanese and their American-born children after Pearl Harbor. </p><p>But Warren was no ideologue. Rather, he was guided by a strong sense of fair play and a fervent belief that the high court's mandate was to achieve the Founders' basic intent: All men are created equal. Sworn in as chief justice on Oct. 5, 1953, he would over the next 16 years "remake the nation's voting rights, empower criminal defendants, break down racial segregation, halt the demagogic pursuit of Communists, expand the rights of protest and dissent, embolden newspapers to challenge public leaders, and re-imagine the relationship between liberty and security in a free society," Newton writes. "[I]n the face of bitter opposition, the Warren Court imported the great values of America's Declaration of Independence and the promises of its Bill of Rights into the working life of the nation." </p><p>Newton, a longtime reporter, editor and now city-county bureau chief for the Los Angeles Times, draws on a vast trove of academic, government and private materials, as well as the personal reflections of surviving relatives and associates. He traces Warren's path from young donkey rider and indifferent student through his World War I Army service, a UC Berkeley law degree and his ambitious rise from Alameda County prosecutor to state attorney general and governor in 1943. His ingratiating personal style and generally safe politics helped him win reelection twice more, with the enthusiastic backing of the state's business establishment and its two most influential conservative newspapers, the Oakland Tribune and The Times. </p><p>Not only were Warren's political acts mostly safe and circumspect, but he also was a Norman Rockwell-esque vision of the staunch Western Republican - big, bold, blue-eyed. Born in 1891 to Swedish and Norwegian immigrant working-class parents, he was a dedicated husband and father of six, an avid hunter, camper and hiker, a Mason, a passionate baseball and football fan and a regular churchgoer who liked an evening drink or two and a good cigar - in short, a real man's man. </p><p>As governor, Newton writes, Warren was hard-working and conscientious but always ambitious for higher office. He campaigned hard to win the GOP vice presidential nomination in 1948 and sought the top spot in 1952, only to see the winner, Eisenhower, choose Warren's main California rival, Richard Nixon, as his No. 2. Eisenhower later wrote that Warren's views "seemed to reflect high ideals and a great deal of common sense," but the governor was too much like himself, and he wanted balance on the ticket, including youth. (Nixon was 39, Warren 61.) Eisenhower also passed over Warren for a Cabinet post but, after several conversations with him, finally promised the first Supreme Court vacancy through his broker, Atty. Gen. Herbert Brownell. Eisenhower viewed Warren as a perfect counterbalance to the New Deal liberals on the court. Based on that assurance, Warren had announced in 1953 his resolve not to run for governor again when Chief Justice Fred Vinson died unexpectedly. </p><p>Warren immediately "struck a pose of public reserve while at the same time moving to claim the promise he felt was his." Eisenhower believed that he had promised Warren only an associate justice post, not the top one; he privately offered the job to Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. But Warren furiously worked the phones, importuning influential political, academic, business and religious leaders around the country - including his friend J. Edgar Hoover. Brownell finally went to Eisenhower and said, "We're stuck with him, I guess." The president relented - a decision he would soon come to deeply regret. </p><p>The fractious court Warren joined was composed of one Republican (Justice Harold H. Burton) and seven Democrats, including the brilliant jurists Hugo L. Black, William O. Douglas, Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson. The four fought often. Jackson and Frankfurter supported a restrained judiciary, while Black and Douglas argued for a more activist court. On controversial issues, not much had gotten done. In short order, Warren demonstrated his extraordinary leadership qualities. </p><p>African American ferment over segregation had been increasing rapidly since the end of World War II; by 1953, it had distilled into a battle over Brown vs. Board of Education, a case Warren inherited. The plaintiffs argued that segregated schools were intrinsically unequal because they signified racial inferiority, and sought to overturn an 1896 Supreme Court ruling that separate public facilities were not necessarily unequal, and thus were legal. </p><p>Some justices thought Congress should settle such matters with new laws. Some wanted to kick the matter back to the lower courts. Others wanted to stall for time, fearing social upheaval. While an anxious South waited, Warren charmed and cajoled. In May 1954, the court struck down the "separate but equal" doctrine and ordered schools integrated "with all deliberate speed." The vote was unanimous. In less than a year, Newton writes, Warren "had united his brilliant Court into a single voice on an issue of moral urgency." </p><p>Eisenhower was furious. He'd told Warren that Southerners "are not bad people. All they are concerned about is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown Negroes," the justice wrote in his memoirs. He never forgave Eisenhower for that remark and went on to lead the court on decisions that would further irritate the president - and inflame the John Birch Society, which dotted the nation with "Impeach Earl Warren" signs. </p><p>This tough-minded but essentially admiring book is itself an act of considerable courage. Warren's enthusiasm for locking up the state's Japanese and refusing to apologize for so doing (he sincerely thought he was acting in California's best interest) makes praising him politically incorrect, especially among liberal Democrats. He is an unmentionable anathema to today's ruling Republicans. So, the legacy of Bakersfield's Earl Warren, who died in 1974, remains suspended in silent limbo. Newton's book is a loud protest against that silence. -- <i>Karl Fleming, <i>Los Angeles Times</i></i><br><br>On my office wall hangs a faded leaflet I picked up on a Dallas street the day John F. Kennedy was shot. It shows two police-booking-style photos of the president, beneath which blares the line "Wanted for Treason" and the accusations that he aided "Communist inspired racial riots" and "illegally invaded a sovereign state" when he sent U.S. troops to quell a riot that greeted a black student's entrance to the University of Mississippi in 1962. <br><br> Just weeks before Kennedy's 1963 murder, Ku Klux Klan bombers killed four girls in a church in Birmingham, Ala. Earlier, civil rights leader Medgar Evers was assassinated in Mississippi, and Gov. George Wallace defied court orders to integrate the University of Alabama. Segregationist Southerners blamed Kennedy and the allegedly Communist-backed Martin Luther King for all of it. <br><br> But the man behind the destruction of the century-old Southern system of racial segregation was not Kennedy or any Democrat at all. That man was Earl Warren, the former Republican governor of California who was appointed chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court by a Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower. By the late '60s, the solidly Democratic South had defected to the GOP because of Democratic support for civil rights legislation sparked by the Warren court's decisions. <br><br> A further irony is that Warren was an almost stereotypical Republican before joining the high court. As Jim Newton reveals in his meticulously researched and well-told new biography, "Justice for All," Warren was a zealous prosecutor, passionately anti-Communist, pro-business, anti-New Deal, anti-gambling, anti-pornography, tough on crime (his father was murdered in their Bakersfield home in 1938), and he favored interning California's Japanese and their American-born children after Pearl Harbor. <br><br> But Warren was no ideologue. Rather, he was guided by a strong sense of fair play and a fervent belief that the high court's mandate was to achieve the Founders' basic intent: All men are created equal. Sworn in as chief justice on Oct. 5, 1953, he would over the next 16 years "remake the nation's voting rights, empower criminal defendants, break down racial segregation, halt the demagogic pursuit of Communists, expand the rights of protest and dissent, embolden newspapers to challenge public leaders, and re-imagine the relationship between liberty and security in a free society," Newton writes. "[I]n the face of bitter opposition, the Warren Court imported the great values of America's Declaration of Independence and the promises of its Bill of Rights into...</p></p><h2>The Diaries of Jane Somers</h2><p>These two novels show Lessing returning to an earlier narrative style with fresh power.</p><p>These two extraordinarily engaging fictional diaries narrated by Jane (Janna) Somers crackle with energy, dry takes on the foibles of modern life, and bracingly grating relationships that often ring true.

Leading scholars of various religious traditions (including Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican, Greek Orthodox, and Jewish) and from many parts of the world (Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States) have been carefully selected for each article by editors Botterweck, Ringgren, and Fabry and their consultants, George W. Anderson, Henri Cazelles, David Noel Freedman, Shemaryahu Talmon, and Gerhard Wallis.<br><br>The intention of the writers is to concentrate on <i>meaning</i>, starting from the more general, everyday senses and building to an understanding of theologically significant concepts. To avoid artificially restricting the focus of the articles, <i>TDOT</i> considers under each keyword the larger groups of words that are related linguistically or semantically. The lexical work includes detailed surveys of a word&#x2019;s occurrences, not only in biblical material but also in other ancient Near Eastern writings. Sumerian, Akkadian, Egyptian, Ethiopic, Ugaritic, and Northwest Semitic sources are surveyed, among others, as well as the Qumran texts and the Septuagint; and in cultures where no cognate word exists, the authors often consider cognate ideas.<br><br><i>TDOT&#x2019;</i>s emphasis, though, is on Hebrew terminology and on biblical usage. The contributors employ philology as well as form-critical and traditio-historical methods, with the aim of understanding the religious statements in the Old Testament. Extensive bibliographical information adds to the value of this reference work.<br><br>This English edition attempts to serve the needs of Old Testament students without the linguistic background of more advanced scholars; it does so, however, without sacrificing the needs of the latter. Ancient scripts (Hebrew, Greek, etc.) are regularly transliterated in a readable way, and meanings of foreign words are given in many cases where the meanings might be obvious to advanced scholars. Where the Hebrew text versification differs from that of English Bibles, the English verse appears in parentheses. Such features will help all earnest students of the Bible to avail themselves of the manifold theological insights contained in this monumental work.</p><p>The intentions of the writers is to concentrate on meaning, starting from the more general, everyday senses and building to an understanding of theologically significant concepts.G.

Forthright and realistic, <i>Moral Man and Immoral Society</i> argues that individual morality is intrinsically incompatible with collective life, thus making social and political conflict inevitable.

The formidable Henry VIII had recently assumed the throne in England, and conflicting ideas about religion were fueling the Reformation throughout Europe. A scathing satire, &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RUtopia&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R was hugely successful and vaulted More to the forefront of the growing humanist movement. &amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP&amp;&amp;RThe story of &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RUtopia&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R is told by a mysterious sailor named Raphael Hythloday, who travels to the New World with the Italian explorer Vespucci and remains at a fort built at the farthest point reached. From there, he discovers a strange island kingdom named Utopia, a pagan and communist city-state in which language, social customs, dress, architecture, and education are identical throughout the country&#x2019;s fifty-four cities. The Utopians have eliminated wealth, the nobility, and currency. Labor and goods are distributed equally and property is held in common.

More, a noted humanist whose friendship with Erasmus and authorship of <i>Utopia</i> earned him great fame in Europe, succeeded Cardinal Wolsey as Lord Chancellor of London at the time of the English Reformation. In 1535, More was martyred for his refusal to support Henry VIII's divorce and break with Rome. Ackroyd's biography is a masterpiece in several senses. Perhaps most importantly, he corrects the mistaken impression that Robert Bolt's <i>A Man for All Seasons</i> has given two generations of theater and film audiences: More was not, as Bolt's drama would have us believe, a civil disobedient who put his conscience above the law. Ackroyd explains that "conscience was not for More an individual matter." Instead, it was derived from "the laws of God and of reason." If the greatest justice in this book is analytic, however, its greatest joys are descriptive. Ackroyd brings 16th-century London to life for his readers--an exotic world where all of life is enveloped by the church: "As the young More made his way along the lanes and thoroughfares, there was the continual sound of bells." --<i>Michael Joseph Gross</i>Thomas More&#39;s Utopia is one of the supreme achievements of Renaissance humanism.

Gen. Hal Moore and Joe Galloway return to Vietnam and reflect on how the war changed them, their men, their enemies, and both countries&#x2014;often with surprising results.</blockquote><p>More than fifteen years since its original publication, the number one <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>We Were Soldiers Once . . . and Young</em> is still required reading in all branches of the military. Now Moore and Galloway revisit their relationships with ten American veterans of the battle&#x2014;men such as Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley and helicopter pilot Bruce "Old Snake" Crandall&#x2014;as well as Lt. Gen. Nguyen Hu An, who commanded the North Vietnamese Army troops on the other side, and two of his old company commanders. These men and their countries have all changed dramatically since the first head-on collision between the two great armies back in November 1965.</p><p>Traveling back to the red-dirt battlefields, commanders and veterans from both sides make the long and difficult journey from old enemies to new friends. After a trip in a Russian-made helicopter to the Ia Drang Valley in the Central Highlands, with the Vietnamese pilots using Moore's vintage U.S. Army maps and Galloway's Boy Scout compass to guide them, they reach the hallowed ground where so many died. All the men are astonished at how nature has reclaimed the land once scarred by bullets, napalm, and blood. As darkness falls, the unthinkable happens&#x2014;the authors and many of their old comrades are stranded overnight, alone, left to confront the ghosts of the departed among the termite hills and creek bed. </p><p>Moore and Galloway combine gritty and vivid detail with reverence and respect for their comrades. Their ability to capture man's sense of heroism and brotherhood, their love for their men and their former enemies, and their fascination with the history of this enigmatic country make for riveting reading. With sixteen pages of photos, tributes to departed friends and loved ones, and General Moore's reflections on lessons learned throughout his military career, <em>We Are Soldiers Still</em> puts a human face on warfare in a way that will not soon be forgotten.</p></p><p><p>Lt.

It would be a monumental task for Moore and Galloway to top their classic 1992 memoir, <i>We Were Soldiers Once... and Young</i>. But they come close in this sterling sequel, which tells the backstory of two of the Vietnam War's bloodiest battles (in which Moore participated as a lieutenant colonel), their first book and a 1993 ABC-TV documentary that brought them back to the battlefield. Moore's strong first-person voice reviews the basics of the November 1965 battles, part of the 34-day Battle of the Ia Drang Valley. Among other things, Moore and Galloway (who covered the battle for UPI) offer portraits of two former enemy commanders, generals Nguyen Huu An and Chu Huy Man, whom the authors met&#x2014;and bonded with&#x2014;nearly three decades after the battle. This book proves again that Moore is an exceptionally thoughtful, compassionate and courageous leader (he was one of a handful of army officers who studied the history of the Vietnam wars before he arrived) and a strong voice for reconciliation and for honoring the men with whom he served. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos. <i>(Aug. 19)</i> ""<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Author Trocme covers how each of the designers got started in the field, their sources of inspiration, and the signature methods of decorating that mark each as an innovator in interior design. Besides profiling each designer, Trocme describes the underlying history that has helped shape new styles of interior decorating in this century. Large color photographs of each designer's work--often of his or her own home--give the reader a clear idea of why these individuals have had such a powerful influence. Some of the designers covered are no longer alive, but their work lives on in the fabric lines and design firms still in business today, which Trocme includes in a directory at the back of the book.</p><p> If you're trying to pinpoint a decorating style that's most appealing to you, a walk through <i>Influential Interiors</i> can help you define and create that style.

Silent fellows like the lawn gnome get earmuffs. Mythical pals, like unicorns, get a horoscope book. Some of the humor may be above the heads of the intended audience, but the sheer volume of silly stuff means there&#x2019;s probably something for everyone.

A beleaguered government and a vengeful public target two groups as scapegoats: pacifists and homosexuals. Many are jailed, others lead dangerous double lives, the "the eye in the door" becomes a symbol of the paranoia that threatens to destroy the very fabric of British society.<br> <br> Central to this novel are such compelling, richly imagined characters as the brilliant and compassionate Dr. William Rivers; his most famous patient, the poet Siegfried Sassoon; and Lieutenant Billy Prior, who plays a central role as a domestic intelligence agent.&nbsp; With compelling, realistic dialogue and a keen eye for the social issues that have gone overlooked in mainstream media, <b>The Eye in the Door</b> is a triumph that equals <i>Regeneration</i> and the third novel in the trilogy, the 1995 Booker Prize-winning <i>The Ghost Road</i>, establishing Pat Barker's place in the very forefront of contemporary novelists.</p><p><b>The Eye in the Door</b> is the second installation of Pat Barker's acclaimed and haunting historical fiction trilogy about British soldiers traumatized by World War I trench warfare and the methods used by psychiatrist William Rivers to treat them. As with the other two, the book was recognized with awards, winning the 1993 Guardian Fiction Prize. Here, Lieutenant Billy Prior is tormented by figuring out which side of several coins does he live -- coward or hero, crazy or sane, homosexual or heterosexual, upper class or lower. He represents the upheaval in Britain during the war and the severe trauma felt by its soldiers. The writing is sparse yet multilayered; Barker uses the lives of a few to capture an entire society during a tumultuous period.<b>PAT BARKER</b> has earned a place in the first rank of contemporary British writers with such novels as <i>Union Street</i>, <i>Regeneration</i> (shortlisted for Britain's prestigious Booker Prize and chosen by the <i>New York Times</i> as one of the four best novels of 1992), <i>The Eye in the Door</i> (winner of the 1993 Guardian fiction prize), and <i>The Ghost Road</i> (winner of the 1995 Booker Prize).

Fiona, the youngest and only surviving daughter of Lord Bemin, is just coming of age, and about to assume the duties of a Weyrwoman, when word spreads that dragons have indeed begun succumbing to the new contagion. With the next season of Threadfall quickly approaching, and the already diminished ranks of the dragons once more under siege, every Weyr across Pern is in crisis mode.

He looked expectantly to K&#x2019;lior. <br><br>The youngest Weyrleader of Pern shifted uneasily under the gray- haired man&#x2019;s gaze. Well aware that M&#x2019;tal had been a Weyrleader since before K&#x2019;lior was born, he found it hard to refute such a length of experience. Of course, C&#x2019;rion was even older still and had made <i>his </i>feelings well- known. <br><br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; M&#x2019;tal began again, his hands outstretched in a placating gesture, &#x201c;just think&#x2013;&#x201d; <br><br>He broke off as his ears detected the unmistakable hum of dragons at Hatching. He smiled and gestured at K&#x2019;lior. &#x201c;Weyrleader?&#x201d; <br><br>K&#x2019;lior was already on his feet and heading for the doorway that led to the Hatching Grounds. <br><br>Kindan and Kentai, Fort Weyr&#x2019;s harper, were waiting on the stairs to the viewing stands in the Hatching Grounds, ready to escort the more feeble or overly- excited holders up to a good perch. Kindan nodded to M&#x2019;tal as the Weyrleader passed by, still engrossed in fer�vent conversation with the Istan and Fort Weyrleaders. <br><br>&#x201c;I see D&#x2019;gan has departed,&#x201d; Kentai murmured to Kindan as the Weyrleaders climbed out of earshot.<br> <br>Kindan shrugged. He knew that M&#x2019;tal had not been counting on D&#x2019;gan&#x2019;s support anyway. He was less pleased at the looks he&#x2019;d seen on C&#x2019;rion&#x2019;s and K&#x2019;lior&#x2019;s faces&#x2013;neither looked very thrilled with what M&#x2019;tal was saying to them. Kindan, who was familiar with M&#x2019;tal&#x2019;s plan, shook his head. Couldn&#x2019;t the other Weyrleaders see that watch- whers, with their night- seeing eyes, were <i>supposed </i>to fly the night Threadfalls? <br><br>&#x201c;Lord Itaral, Lady Nelyssa,&#x201d; Kentai called as he spotted the Lord and Lady Holders of Ruatha Hold. He smiled as he spotted the third person in their party. &#x201c;I see that you&#x2019;ve convinced Lady Ilyssa to join you this time.&#x201d; He nodded to their young daughter and raised an elbow invitingly. &#x201c;May I escort you to your seats?&#x201d; <br><br>Ilyssa blushed, but, overcoming her embarrassed smile, curt�sied most elegantly and took his arm. <br><br>&#x201c;This is Kindan,&#x201d; Kentai said with a nod toward the other harper. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s come with Lord M&#x2019;tal from Benden Weyr.&#x201d; <br><br>Lady Nelyssa started at his name and peered at him more closely. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you the one&#x2013;&#x201d; She caught herself and rapidly switched her comment. &#x201c;&#x2013;I mean, aren&#x2019;t you the young man who gave up his watch- wher to Nuella, the WherMaster?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Among other things, I am known for that,&#x201d; Kindan agreed, in�clining his head politely and giving her a slight smile. He knew what she&#x2019;d started to say, and wondered if he would ever live down the stigma of the fire in the Harper Hall&#x2019;s Archive rooms. He hadn&#x2019;t been solely responsible, after all, and he&#x2019;d fought the hard�est to put the blaze out, preserving countless other Records . . . <br><br>&#x201c;Kindan!&#x201d; <br><br>Before he could even react to the sound of his name, the speaker pummeled into him, clutching him tightly about the waist and trying her best to squeeze the breath out of him. Brilliant sea- blue eyes looked out from behind a lock of rebellious honey- blond hair as the youngster turned her head and called back accusingly to the well- dressed Lord Holder behind her, &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t tell me he&#x2019;d be here!&#x201d; <br><br>Bemin of Fort Hold smiled indulgently at his daughter. &#x201c;There are such things as surprises, Fiona,&#x201d; he said with a wink. <br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Kindan, it&#x2019;s so good to see you!&#x201d; Fiona exclaimed, burying her face once more in Kindan&#x2019;s chest. <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s good to see you, too,&#x201d; Kindan replied. He held out a hand to Fort Hold&#x2019;s Lord Holder. The older man, face lined with age and sad memories, took it in his own and gripped it tightly. <br><br>&#x201c;Good to see you again, lad,&#x201d; Bemin said. He looked up the stairs. &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;d better get up there or the dragons will all have hatched.&#x201d; <br><br>Fiona turned toward the steps, firmly locking her arms around Kindan&#x2019;s elbow. &#x201c;Harper Kindan,&#x201d; she said, sounding every inch a Lord Holder&#x2019;s daughter, &#x201c;would you do me the honor of escorting me?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;It would be my pleasure, Lady Fiona,&#x201d; Kindan replied with equal aplomb. A bronze fire- lizard darted down from the heights, alighted for a moment on Kindan&#x2019;s shoulder, chirped happily to him, then rose again in the air. <br><br>Lord Bemin chuckled. &#x201c;I see that Valla followed you.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t keep him away from a Hatching,&#x201d; Kindan confessed. He craned his neck up and scanned the swarm of fire- lizards over�head. &#x201c;Where are Jokester and Fire?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;We left them behind,&#x201d; Bemin said. &#x201c;I doubt either of them is as well- trained as yours.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Well, they&#x2019;ve barely two Turns out of the shell,&#x201d; Kindan allowed. &#x201c;Give them time.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Like all youngsters, they are impetuous and brash,&#x201d; Bemin agreed with a twinkle in his eyes. &#x201c;Why, you would not believe where I found my daughter&#x2013;&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Father!&#x201d; Fiona protested, a warm blush highlighting her freckles. Bemin laughed. <br><br>&#x201c;Chasing tunnel snakes again?&#x201d; Kindan asked her in a voice pitched for her ears alone. <br><br>He was not successful, as Bemin snorted, saying, &#x201c;I cannot teach her any decorum at all!&#x201d; He continued, &#x201c;She was hours in the bath and I&#x2019;m sure there&#x2019;s still dirt on her.&#x201d; <br><br>Kindan felt Fiona grab him tighter and heard her groan, but when he glanced down he saw the smile in her eyes. <br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s sounding much happier,&#x201d; he said quietly. <br><br>&#x201c;He deserves it,&#x201d; Fiona replied. <br><br>Kindan nodded in agreement. Lord Holder Bemin had kept his Hold together twelve Turns before when the Plague had struck and killed nearly one in four of his Holders, including his wife and all his children, save for the youngest, Fiona. <br><br>Kindan, sent from the Harper Hall to Fort Hold in disgrace after the fire, had helped Fort&#x2019;s old Healer, Kilti, to do everything pos�sible for the sick and dying. In the end, Kilti had succumbed to the Plague himself, leaving Kindan, at fourteen, in charge. <br><br>Fiona cocked her head at a change in the sound and then leapt up the steps, dragging Kindan along. &#x201c;Come on, they&#x2019;re hatching!&#x201d; <br><br>Indeed they were. Kindan, Fiona, and Bemin found seats saved for them next to Lord Itaral and his family. <br><br>&#x201c;Just some greens,&#x201d; Ilyssa assured Fiona as she patted the empty seat she&#x2019;d saved for her friend. Fiona relinquished her grip on Kindan with an apologetic look and happily took her place be�side Ilyssa. The two leaned toward each other and began to speak in low voices. <br><br>The hot sands rapidly filled with white- robed candidates, flown in by Fort Weyr&#x2019;s bronze dragons. The rest of Fort&#x2019;s dragons, perched high above, hummed in welcome, the sound growing louder as the eggs began to rock and crack. <br><br>Suddenly there was a hush as the first egg cracked open. A brown dragonet flopped out, awkward and creeling. A group of candidates darted anxiously around it&#x2013;some moving toward it, some away. And then&#x2013;one candidate reached out to the baby dragon and Impressed. The dragons hummed approvingly.<br>Another dragonet burst forth from its egg, and another, and another. From the stands, it seemed as though of tide of white- robed candidates flowed and ebbed around the blue, green, brown, and bronze dragonets until, finally, one white- robed figure stood pro�tectively beside each dragonet as the miracle of Impression was repeated. <br><br>&#x201c;Look there!&#x201d; Fiona called, pointing toward one of the larger eggs. &#x201c;Is that a queen?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;It could be,&#x201d; Kindan said. A great rent appeared in the shell, followed moments later by a golden head. &#x201c;It is!&#x201d; <br><br>The little queen made quick work of extricating herself from her egg while all around the bronzes crooned excitedly. Freed at last, the little gold queen walked around, looking from one candidate to another. <br><br>&#x201c;What would happen if there wasn&#x2019;t a suitable candidate?&#x201d; Fiona muttered to Kindan, who shrugged in response. The girls were trying; one bold girl just barely dodged the dragonet&#x2019;s awkward movements, pulled aside at the last moment by a shorter, younger, dark- haired girl. <br><br>Kentai had overheard the exchange. &#x201c;There are Records,&#x201d; he said, looking uncomfortable. <br><br>&#x201c;Well, she&#x2019;s coming this way,&#x201d; Ilyssa noted with excitement. <br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re near the exit to the Bowl,&#x201d; Kentai remarked. &#x201c;Maybe she&#x2019;s looking for someone out there.&#x201d; <br><br>She wasn&#x2019;t.

The De Sotos are friendly and professional toward all their patients, from chipmunks to donkeys to cows, the exception being "cats and other dangerous animals," as stated clearly on the sign outside the office. But the De Sotos are tender-hearted rodents, so when a miserable fox shows up begging for treatment, they agree to have a look (perhaps against their better judgment). As it turns out, this fox, with "a rotten bicuspid and unusually bad breath," manages to behave himself while tiny Doctor De Soto is standing mid-molar inside his gaping jaws. When the wily fox returns the next day to get his replacement gold tooth, however, he has mouse-flavored snacks on his mind. Luckily, Doctor De Soto and his wife have anticipated such despicable canine intentions, and find a way to outfox the ungrateful fox. <p> William Steig, award-winning creator of <i>Sylvester and the Magic Pebble</i>, once again offers young readers a clever, amusing tale of interspecies mingling.

Steig was born in New York City. Every member of his family was involved in the arts, and so it was no surprise when he decided to become an artist. He attended City College and the National Academy of Design. In 1930, Steig's work began appearing in <i>The New Yorker</i>, where his drawings have been a popular fixture ever since. He published his first children's book, <i>Roland the Minstrel Pig</i>, in 1968. </p><p>In 1970, Steig received the Caldecott Medal for <i>Sylvester and the Magic Pebble</i>. His books for children also include D<i>ominic; The Real Thief; The Amazing Bone, a Caldecott Honor Book; Amos &amp; Boris</i>, a National Book Award finalist; and <i>Abel's Island</i> and <i>Doctor De Soto</i>, both Newbery Honor Books. Steig's books have also received the Christopher Award, the Irma Simonton Black Award, the William Allen White Children's Book Award, and the American Book Award. His European awards include the Premio di Letteratura per l'infanzia (Italy), the Silver Pencil Award (the Netherlands), and the Prix de la Fondation de France. On the basis of his entire body of work, Steig was selected as the 1982 U.S. candidate for the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for Illustration and subsequently as the 1988 U.S. candidate for Writing. </p><p>Stieg also published thirteen collections of drawings for adults, beginning with <i>About People</i> in 1939, and including <i>The Lonely Ones, Male/Female, The Agony in the Kindergarten</i>, and <i>Our Miserable Life</i>. </p><p>He died in Boston at the age of 95.</p></p><h2>High Performance Sailing</h2><p><p>Based on 25 years of research and Olympic coaching, <i>High Performance Sailing</i> reinvents the strategies of sailboat racing. It presents revolutionary explanations of wind prediction and boat design, a fundamental rethinking of how to sail a boat fast--literally faster than the wind. Bethwaite's theories boosted the average speed of the highest-performance sailboats from two-thirds the windspeed to windspeed or faster. Bethwaite is Australia's most successful Olympic coach, and his family includes three Olympic sailing champions and three world champions. This book will have a revolutionary impact on racing sailboats and the way they are sailed. </p><p>"Essential for any serious racing sailor."--Gary Jobson </p><p>"It represents a breakthrough in the way that it relates the theoretical aspects of wind, seastate and rig shape to the way a crew would sail and handle a boat during a race. It has the potential to be a standard reference work on the subject and will not quickly date. It is a book that my Olympic squad will benefit from."--Rod Carr, British Olympic Sailing Team Manager </p><p>"Frank's book is a treasure chest, full of brilliant insights into the ways of air and water as they flow around our sailing boats. Best of all, he tells us what to do when we go sailing."--Alan Payne, Designer of America's Cup challengers <i>Gretal I</i> and <i>II</i> </p><p>"Allowed only one 'if only' in yacht racing . . . it would have been to have read Frank Bethwaite's <i>High Performance Sailing</i> years ago and to have it available for constant reference. Taking all the advice which he offers from his wide experience would have made championship winning a great deal easier."--Bob Fisher, Journalist, broadcaster and winner of many national and international sailing championships </p><p>"The most significant scientific thinking about sailboat racing to come along in three decades. A brilliant and important book for serious racing sailors."--Ed Adams, US Sailing Team Coach; national, North American, and world champion sailor </p><p>"Bethwaite's grasp of the entire spectrum of sailing speed is unique and formidable."--Gerry Hoyt, Yacht designer, sailing speed innovator</p></p><p><p><b>Frank Bethwaite</b> has been at the leading edge of national and world class sailing for over fifty years. Apart from his own outstanding racing successes, he has coached every level of would-be champion from basic to Olympic standards. Within his own family, three are Olympic champions and three are world champions in four classes. </p><p>From a background which included aeronautical engineering and meteorology, Frank spent thirty years in military and civil aviation and finally in scientific flying. His leisure pursuits, other than sailing, have been model gliders (twice open world endurance record holder) and also flying high performance gliders, which he used to explore the detail of some of the atmosphere's movements. </p><p>When he retired from flying he decided to find out how sailboats worked, so that he could try to make them sail faster. The experimental years followed, in which a combination of controlled experiments and fleet evaluation released a surge of creativity and the average speed of small sailboats increased from about one third the windspeed to about one half. This work then blended into a period when Frank and his family became involved with very high performance boats, partly the eighteen foot skiffs of Sydney and partly a series of twenty much smaller and progressively faster experimental craft. That the average "round the buoys race" speed of two thirds the wind speed has now increased to windspeed or faster, is in no small way due to Frank's theoretical and experimental input.</p>"One of the most readable books on the complex subject of sailing faster, and without doubt, a must for every racing sailor."&#x2014;<i><b>Yachts and Yachting</b></i><br></p><h2>More Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</h2><p><p>All those who enjoyed shuddering their way through Alvin Schwartz's first volume of <em>Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark</em> will find a satisfyingly spooky sequel in this new collection of the macabre, the funny, and the fantastic.</p><p>Is it possible to die -- and not know it?

Irving uses dramatic pauses effectively in his mesmerizing baritone or his deep bass. Geared toward preteens, this excellent mixture of stories showcases Irving&#39;s finesse both as a living being and . . . as a dead one. J.H.B.

This edict defined Christian orthodoxy and brought to an end a lively and wide-ranging debate about the nature of God; all other interpretations were now declared heretical. It was the first time in a thousand years of Greco-Roman civilization free thought was unambiguously suppressed. Yet surprisingly, the popular histories claim that the Christian Church reached a consensus on the Trinity at the Council of Constantinople in AD 381. Why has Theodosius&#39;s revolution been airbrushed from the historical record? In this groundbreaking new book, acclaimed historian Charles Freeman shows that the council was in fact a sham, only taking place after Theodosius&#39;s decree had become law. The Church was acquiescing in the overwhelming power of the emperor. Freeman argues that Theodosius&#39;s edict and the subsequent suppression of paganism not only brought an end to the diversity of religious and philosophical beliefs throughout the empire, but created numerous theological problems for the Church, which have remained unsolved. The year AD 381, as Freeman puts it, was &#34;a turning point which time forgot.&#34;</p><p>In more than thirty years, <b>Charles Freeman</b>'s travels have taken him to most of the sites mentioned in The Greek Achievement, from Aphrodisias to Olympia, from Troy to Delphi. He has dug on all three continents surrounding the Mediterranean and served as academic director on summer schools on Renaissance Italy. His books include EGYPT, GREECE AND ROME; CIVILIZATIONS OF THE ANCIENT MEDITERRANEAN; and LEGACIES OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS."<i>A.D. 381</i> is a well-argued and -documented study of the rise of the monotheistic state in the late Roman Empire and its aftereffects. Of the many excellences in Freeman's book, not least are the eloquence, grace, and subtlety of argument with which he presents his case. Invaluable for all academic collections and of interest for larger public collections as well." -<i>Library Journal</i></p><h2>Green Shadows, White Whale</h2><p>In Ireland to write a screenplay for an epic film adaptation of Moby Dick, an inexperienced screenwriter must confront both a mythical beast and a great director while he discovers the secrets of the Irish. 25,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p><p>In a career spanning more than seventy years, Ray Bradbury, who died on June 5, 2011 at the age of 91, inspired generations of readers to dream, think, and create. A prolific author of hundreds of short stories and close to fifty books, as well as numerous poems, essays, operas, plays, teleplays, and screenplays, Bradbury was one of the most celebrated writers of our time. His groundbreaking works include <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, <em>The Martian Chronicles</em>, <em>The Illustrated Man</em>, <em>Dandelion Wine</em>, and <em>Something Wicked This Way Comes</em>. He wrote the screen play for John Huston's classic film adaptation of <em>Moby Dick</em>, and was nominated for an Academy Award. He adapted sixty-five of his stories for television's <em>The Ray Bradbury Theater</em>, and won an Emmy for his teleplay of <em>The Halloween Tree</em>. He was the recipient of the 2000 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the 2004 National Medal of Arts, and the 2007 Pulitzer Prize Special Citation, among many honors.</p><p>Throughout his life, Bradbury liked to recount the story of meeting a carnival magician, Mr. Electrico, in 1932. At the end of his performance Electrico reached out to the twelve-year-old Bradbury, touched the boy with his sword, and commanded, "Live forever!" Bradbury later said, "I decided that was the greatest idea I had ever heard. I started writing every day. I never stopped."</p>Ray Bradbury, the current master of science fiction, narrates his semi-autobiographical novel of his visit to Ireland to work with director John Huston on the script of &#34;Moby Dick.&#34; This fast-paced audio is a tour de force; Bradbury brings verbal images of Ireland to life with no effort at all. He also brings off the real life vocal style of Huston so believably that you think Huston came back from the grave to record this. The piece flows due to the author&#39;s familiarity with the text. While the packaging looks unprofessional, the audio work inside is more than exceptional. B.P. (c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine</p><h2>After Nature</h2><p><b>After Nature</b>, W. G. Sebald&#x2019;s first literary work, now translated into English by Michael Hamburger, explores the lives of three men connected by their restless questioning of humankind&#x2019;s place in the natural world. From the efforts of each, &#x201c;an order arises, in places beautiful and comforting, though more cruel, too, than the previous state of ignorance.&#x201d; The first figure is the great German Re-naissance painter Matthias Gr�newald. The second is the Enlightenment botanist-explorer Georg Steller, who accompanied Bering to the Arctic. The third is the author himself, who describes his wanderings among landscapes scarred by the wrecked certainties of previous ages.<br><br><b>After Nature</b> introduces many of the themes that W. G. Sebald explored in his subsequent books. A haunting vision of the waxing and waning tides of birth and devastation that lie behind and before us, it confirms the author&#x2019;s position as one of the most profound and original writers of our time.</p><p>&#x201c;In the five or six years before he was killed in December 2001, Max Sebald began to reap the harvest of a lifetime&#x2019;s immaculate thinking, feeling, and writing. He became widely celebrated for the originality of his forms, for his range, and for his emotional seriousness. All these things are present here, in the first of his posthumously published works. In language that is at once plainly strong and spiderishly delicate, he addresses the themes of migration, stillness, and remembering which were his recurrent preoccupation. But by presenting them within the mixed disciplines and freedoms of blank verse, he gives them terrific freshness and potency. <b>After Nature</b> is a deeply intelligent book, but also a marvelously warm, exciting, and compassionate one.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Andrew Motion</b>, Poet Laureate of England<br><br>&#x201c;W.

The author argues that demographic trends were the greatest drivers of our economy, along with radical new technologies, working together to follow a four-stage life cycle of innovation, growth, shakeout, and maturity. While Dent's doomsday predictions are depressing, his theories are persuasive and elaborated in meticulous descriptions of historic economic trends and cycles. The author's candor is refreshing, especially when he discusses how equity investments experience a wide variety of returns, including substantial losses or extraordinary gains&#x2014;and that the financial press has failed to remind the public of this fact. The book offers welcome portfolio allocation strategies during an economic crisis, as well as the bad news that the worst of the housing downturn will occur between 2010 and 2013. Along with domestic forecasts, Dent addresses terrorism's economic roots and the growth of megacities in South and East Asia with characteristic thoroughness. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But the ultimate horror takes place when, soon after, Lauren&#x2019;s brutalized corpse is found dumped in an alley. Alex disregards the advice of his trusted friend, LAPD detective Milo Sturgis, and jeopardizes his relationship with longtime lover, Robin Castagna, in order to pursue Lauren&#x2019;s killer. As he investigates his young patient&#x2019;s troubled past, Alex enters the shadowy worlds of fringe psychological experimentation and the sex industry&#x2013;and then into mortal danger, when lust and big money collide in an unforgiving Los Angeles.</p><p>Psychologist Alex Delaware hasn't been in private practice for a long time, but when the mother of a former patient calls and asks for his help, he can't turn her down.

MATT MADDEN is a cartoonist best known for his book <i>99 Ways to Tell a Story: Exercises in Style</i>. Together, Abel and Madden are the authors of <i>Mastering Comics and Drawing Words and Writing Pictures</i>. <br>Starred Review. The focus of this collection is not on any particular genre or style, but on stylistic and storytelling variety. There are slice-of-life stories, historical drama, humor, political satire, absurdist fables, serious autobiography and lighthearted ramblings. The art styles range from the tight, realistic precision of Jason Lute's <i>Berlin</i> to the raw style of John Mejia's vignettes of life as a public school art teacher. With each story the reader is drawn into a different world or presented with another perspective of the same world. Yet despite the variety of the stories, they join as a display of the power of comics as a means of storytelling that can concisely present some aspect of human nature so the reader can digest it, contemplate it and, perhaps, understand it, as Barry, this edition's editor, suggests in her introduction. The variety conveys the continued growth of comics as a means of storytelling, growth brought about by a plethora of promising new creators and continued great work by established creators such as Jaime Hernandez, Matt Groening and Chris Ware. The book offers a strong sampling of the diversity available today and hints at more innovation and progression to come. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For as long as he can remember, this visionary and spiritual teacher has been psychically aware of a spiritual world existing alongside the physical one. <br><br>In 1965, when he was studying biochemistry at Arizona State University, Spangler chose to leave college and follow an inner spiritual calling. Soon after, he encountered an extraordinary presence, which he named "John," and which over the next quarter-century would be his colleague and mentor, assisting him in exploring the "inner worlds" of the spirit. No ordinary teacher, John was Spangler's guide to comprehending the sacredness within us, and he helped build partnerships with the spiritual worlds. John tutored him in some of the most basic mysteries of life and the nature of the human spirit. <br><br>In <i>Apprenticed to Spirit,</i> Spangler recounts how he met John and how John showed him the way to develop a spiritual intelligence-what Spangler calls "a mind of the soul"-and to integrate it into everyday life. Such a development, John said, is important for enhancing a person's creativity and bringing his spiritual energy into focus. Spangler learned to think with his soul and embarked on the apprenticeship to understanding the sacredness of our world and of the realms beyond ours-a journey that continues to this day. This book is the absorbing memoir of one man's journey to understanding how we can learn to lead lives of greater blessing and to be sources of blessing and service for the world as a whole.</p><p><b>David Spangler</b> is a visionary, an author, and a spiritual teacher. A lecturer and teacher since 1964, he is the author of several books, including <i>The Call, Everyday Miracles,</i> and <i>Blessing</i>. He is a cofounder of the Lorian Association and currently serves as director of the Lorian Center for Incarnational Spirituality. Spangler lives in Washington state with his family."<i>Apprenticed to Spirit</i>&nbsp;is a masterpiece of contemporary spiritual literature because it provides readers with a serious, grounded, and authentic story of how one man earned and sustained his relationship with his nonphysical guide. Few people have genuinely accomplished this goal. David Spangler is one who has successfully made the journey."<p>--Caroline Myss, author of <i>Anatomy of the Spirit</i>&nbsp;and <i>Defy Gravity</i>&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;David Spangler has written the kind of life story I most want to read: a story of the evolution of the heart. With candor and deep humanity, he describes a life lived in partnership with inner teachers, and devoted to empowering and inspiring others to recognize and claim their own larger purpose. <i>Apprenticed to Spirit </i>is a beautiful modern soul odyssey. Read this book to learn how to navigate inner worlds, how to build a spirited community and grow your group angel, and how to discern a true teacher.

It is late on a Sunday afternoon in February, overcast and drizzly in Carolina, Puerto Rico. Inside the stadium, there is a game going on, the Escuela de Deportiva against Bayam�n. Nothing special, just teenage boys playing ball, the way they do every afternoon, and then the right fielder from Deportiva scoops up a base hit and fires to second, his throw a bullet -- low, hard, right on the bag. Groups of men huddle in the stands, talking, laughing, playing cards, barely paying attention, or so it seems until the throw. It elicits a murmur of recognition, and suddenly they come alive, stirred by communal memory. All fires are one fire, the novelist Julio Cort�zar once wrote. And all arms are one arm. The throw from right field reminds them of the original, the unsurpassable arm of the man for whom the stadium is named, Roberto Clemente.</p><p>Beyond the stadium, closer to the street, stands a cenotaph thirty feet long and seven and a half feet high. It is the nearest thing to a headstone for Carolina's favorite son. On its three panels the sculptor Jos� Buscaglia has etched the stations of the cross of Roberto Clemente's thirty-eight years on this earth. In the far left panel, Roberto is a babe, held in the arms of his mother in the barrio of San Ant�n, and his father is seen working in the nearby cane fields. In the far right panel, Clemente passes from greatness into legend; first he is being honored for his three-thousandth hit, then his spirit is received by a figure of death in the Atlantic's watery grave, and finally his widow holds the plaque for his induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. But the center panel is the most telling. There, between scenes of Clemente batting, running, fielding, throwing, visiting hospitals, and consoling the sick and the poor, he is depicted standing regal and alone, holding a lamb.</p><p>Memory and myth are entwined in the Clemente story. He has been dead for more than three decades, yet he remains vivid in the sporting consciousness while other athletes come and go, and this despite the fact that he played his entire career in relative obscurity, away from the mythmakers of New York and Los Angeles. Forty public schools, two hospitals, and more than two hundred parks and ballfields bear his name, from Carolina, Puerto Rico, where he was born, to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he played, to far-off Mannheim, Germany. In the world of memorabilia, the demand for anything Clemente is second only to Mickey Mantle, and far greater than Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Juan Marichal, or any other black or Latin players. Extraordinary as he was, Clemente was not the greatest who ever played the game, yet there was something about him that elevated him into his own realm. Much of it had to do with the way he died. He was young. He went down in a plane crash. His body was lost to the sea, never found. He was on a mission of mercy, leaving his family on New Year's Eve to come to the aid of strangers. In Spanish, Clemente means merciful. Some of it had to do with the way he looked and played on the ball field, No. 21, perfectly cut in his Pirates uniform, a portrait of solemn beauty, with his defiant jaw and soulful eyes. And much of it had to do with the way he lived. In sainthood, his people put a lamb in his arms, but he was no saint, and certainly not docile. He was agitated, beautiful, sentimental, unsettled, sweet, serious, selfless, haunted, sensitive, contradictory, and intensely proud of everything about his native land, including himself. To borrow the words of the Puerto Rican poet Enrique Zorrilla, what burned in the cheeks of Roberto Clemente was "the fire of dignity."</p><p></p><p>Copyright � 2006 by David Maraniss</p><p></p>6<p>Alone at the Miracle</p><p>The last time the Pirates played in a World Series, in 1927, the opponents were the same New York Yankees. Then the American League champions terrorized opposing pitchers with a lineup of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, Bob Meusel and Tony Lazzeri, now it was Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris, Yogi Berra and Moose Skowron. Murderers' Row old and new, one baseball legend long established, another in the making. The formula was identical in either case: audacious power, solid pitching, pinstripes, intimidation, all rendered glorious by the self-centered hyperbole of New York and its sporting press.</p><p>Part of the lore of the 1927 Yankees was a boast that the Pirates, after watching the famed sluggers take batting practice before the series opener, felt so overmatched they folded and lost four straight. Harold (Pie) Traynor, Pittsburgh's Hall of Fame third baseman, had bristled at that story for decades, insisting that it was apocryphal. By Traynor's account, the Pirates were in the clubhouse poring over a scouting report when the Yankees took their pregame cuts. Whatever prodigious shots Ruth and Gehrig stroked during batting practice, the Pirates saw none of them. But the debunking of this myth did not sit well with baseball's commissioner, Ford Frick, for the particular reason that it was Frick himself, as a young sportswriter for the <i>New York Journal,</i> who had spread the story in the first place.</p><p>The 1960 Pirates were rated 13-10 underdogs by the bookies, but seemed even less likely than their predecessors to be awed by New York, even though these Yankees had won their last fifteen games of the season heading into the World Series. "We'll fight 'em until our teeth fall out and then we'll grab 'em with our gums," snarled Don Hoak, sounding like the former boxer and inveterate scrapper that he was. It was the nature of this team, Hoak said, that they would always rise to the challenge of the better opponents. Virgil Trucks, the batting practice pitcher, told anyone who approached him in the days before the series opener that Pittsburgh was the most relaxed team he had ever seen. Relaxed and gabby. When it came to quotable quotes, Pittsburgh was a gold mine for visiting sportswriters. Hoak, shortstop Groat (recovered from his wrist injury and ready to play), outfielder Gino Cimoli, trainer Danny Whelan, ace Deacon Law, pudgy old Smoky Burgess (who talked so much behind the plate Richie Ashburn once beseeched the ump to shut him up before Ashburn bopped him over the head with his bat), Vinegar Bend Mizell, the big galoots at first, Dick Stuart and Rocky Nelson, and the story-spinning dark Irishman, manager Danny Murtaugh (prone to blabbing about anything but the game itself) -- they all were go-to guys on deadline. The <i>Post-Gazette,</i> further short-cutting the process, enlisted Hoak, Groat, and Law to write stories during the series, or at least columns published under their by-lines.</p><p>Everyone was in on the action, it seemed, except the Pirate in the middle of the lineup who roamed right field. Roberto Clemente was indisputably an important member of the team, yet also in many ways alone. At the end of his sixth and finest season, he was still separated by culture, race, language, and group dynamics. He was the lone black player in the starting lineup and a Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican, while none of the sportswriters for the major dailies in New York or Pittsburgh were black or spoke Spanish. Life is defined by images, especially public life, and the Pirates image was that of a band of scrappy, happy-go-lucky, fearless, gin-playing, hard-drinking, crew-cut, tobacco-chewing white guys. Where was the place in that picture for the proud, regal, seemingly diffident Roberto Clemente? He had led the team in runs batted in and total bases, finished second in batting average, hits, game-winning hits, runs scored, home runs, and triples, had the best arm on the team, played with style and every bit as much grit as Hoak or Groat, yet now was the invisible man. In the run-up to the World Series, the writers of Pittsburgh and New York, for all their overwrought coverage of the spectacle, gave Clemente barely a passing glance.</p><p>A notable exception, as usual, was the <i>Pittsburgh Courier,</i> the black weekly that had been paying close attention to Clemente all season. On the weekend before the series opener, sports editor Bill Nunn Jr. saw Clemente on the street in Schenley Heights, the middle-class black neighborhood where they both lived, and asked him how he felt about facing the mighty Yankees. The Pirates would win, Clemente assured him, his words echoing Hoak and Trucks. Although the Yankees had more power, he believed Pittsburgh was the better team, stocked with hard-nosed players who could not be intimidated. "We've been a relaxed team all season and I expect us to be the same in the Series," he said. "Pressure didn't get us down during the National League race. We fought off Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Los Angeles without cracking. Now that we've come this far, we aren't going to look back now." In Clemente's estimation, the Braves, not the Yankees, were the second-best team in baseball. "If the Braves had won the pennant, they would have been good enough to beat the Yankees, too." As for playing in Yankee Stadium, Clemente said he would not be haunted by the outfield ghosts of Ruth and DiMaggio, but he was concerned about the late-afternoon shadows. He had played there in the second 1960 All-Star game and found the ball hard to follow.</p><p>Aside from Nunn's interview, the other notice Clemente received before the series was negative. Someone had leaked a scouting report from the Yankees suggesting that the most effective way to pitch him was inside. "Knock him down the first time up and forget him," was the dismissive summary. Clemente laughed when asked about it, but the report bothered him. Like many black stars of that era, in a tradition that went back to Jackie Robinson, he got brushed back nearly every series, and he suspected that opposing pitchers chose him for retaliation in part because of the color of his skin. They'd been knocking him down all season in the National League, Clemente obse...</p></p><h2>The Spy Went Dancing: My Further Adventures as an Undercover Agent</h2><p>The author describes a 1966 mission when she was called out of semi-retirement to uncover a highly placed NATO mole, an assignment for which she recruited an old friend, Wallis Simpson</p><p>YA-- A book that seems as if it came from the pen of one of our popular writers of escapist fiction, this is the autobiography of a beautiful young woman from a small town in New York who was recruited by the OSS during World War II and sent to Spain as a spy. Her successful and dangerous career came to an end in 1947 when she married into one of Spain's oldest and most prestigious families and became a countess. Most of this part of her story was told in The Spy Wore Red (Random, 1987). After almost 20 years as one of Spain's most glamorous socialities, Aline Romanones is again recruited by the CIA to help uncover a mole in NATO headquarters in Paris. During the course of her exploits, she crosses paths with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, Audrey Hepburn, Jackie Kennedy, the embalmed body of Eva Peron, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. The glimpses into the lives of the super-rich and the super-famous alone make the book interesting; the addition of the drama and real danger makes it irresistible. This is the perfect book to hand to girls who love Danielle Steel, Judith Krantz, etc., and who think they don't like nonfiction.<br><i>- Patricia Lilly, Holub Middle School, Alief, TX</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this dramatic sequel to The Spy Wore Red , a memoir of her experiences as an OSS agent, the author reveals more about her life during WW II and later, when, married to a Spanish nobleman, she resumed her career as a spy. Hunting a KGB mole in NATO in 1966, she recruited the Duchess of Windsor who, she shows, greatly enjoyed her minor role in espionage. The duchess is only one player in a dazzling cast with whom the American-born Condesa socializes here, a cast that includes the likes of French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou, Jacqueline Kennedy, the Rothschilds, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. In an exciting denouement she exposes the mole, wrapping up a heretofore unresolved case. Photos not seen by PW .

Each spread focuses on a single line, which is printed in elegant font and incorporated into the painting. Images of animals and the sun recur throughout the book. Some of the pictures are painted in rich colors while others appear to be shadowy, gray pencil sketches. One particularly striking illustration shows an African-American boy drawing with colored chalk on the ground (&#34;Thy will be done on earth&#34;). He is surrounded by a kaleidoscope of wild creatures, sun, and stars. Warren explains the meaning behind the words Jesus taught his disciples with line-by-line commentary, teaching young readers the value of prayer. The artist also offers a reflection on what this prayer means to him.

COOKING is the only all-in-one instructional that details the techniques that cooks really need to master, teaches all the basic recipes, and includes hundreds of photos that illuminate and inspire. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Cooking authority James Peterson's definitive, all-inclusive learn-to-cook cookbook. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;600 hard-working recipes everyone should know how to make-from the perfect roasted chicken to bouillabaisse and apple pie. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;1,500 instructional photos, showing exactly how recipes are made, teach food-literate novices to cook with confidence and more advanced cooks to expand their repertoire.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;James Peterson has more than 1 million cookbooks in print.</p><p>Put simply, <i>Cooking</i> is a revelation. No other cookbook so deftly illustrates as broad a scope of classic culinary methods and flavors as you'll find here. As a veteran chef and award-winning cookbook author, James Peterson is uniquely qualified to take food lovers into the modern kitchen and turn them into passionate, precise, intuitive cooks. What's most impressive about a book of this breadth and size (540 pages and 600 recipes, brought to life with 1500 vivid color photographs) is how accessible and fun it is to read. Every recipe in <i>Cooking</i> sings with a deep knowledge of the ingredients at hand, encouraging cooks not just to follow the recipe but to really understand and relish in the process, and the result is a terrific turn-to reference for any cook seeking inspired instruction. <i>--Anne Bartholomew</i><br><br> <p><b>Luscious Recipes from <i>Cooking</i></b> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><br>Artichoke and Toasted Walnut Salad </p></td> <td><br>Braised Short Ribs </td> <td><br>Classic French Apple Tart</td></tr></tbody></table> <p></p>* Cooking authority James Peterson&#39;s definitive, all-inclusive learn-to-cook cookbook. * 600 hard-working recipes everyone should know how to make--from the perfect roasted chicken to bouillabaisse and apple pie. * 650 instructional photos, showing exactly how recipes are made, teach food-literate novices to cook with confidence and more advanced cooks to expand their repertoire. * James Peterson has more than 1 million cookbooks in print.</p><h2>At the Caf�: Conversations on Anarchism</h2><p>While Malatesta was hiding from the police he regularly went to a cafe in Ancona, Italy. He had shaved off his usual beard but he was still taking a risk. Especially as this wasn't an anarchist cafe, but had a variety of customers including the local policeman. The conversations he had in this caf� became the basis for the dialogues that make up this book. <br><br>For the first time in English, Malatesta, in his usual commonsense and matter-of-fact style, sets out and critically analyses the arguments for and against anarchism. Translated by Paul Nursey-Bray, this is a classic defence of anarchism that anticipates the rise of nationalism, fascism and communism.</p><p>Errico Malatesta (1853-1932) was an anarcho-communist with an unshakable belief, which he shared with his friend Peter Kropotkin, that the anarchist revolution would occur soon. He spent a large part of his life in exile from his homeland of Italy and altogether spent more than ten years in prison. He wrote and edited a number of radical newspapers and was a friend of Mikhail Bakunin.</p><h2>One is Fun!</h2><p>This cookery book provides easy-to-prepare recipes specially devised for the single cook, so that they don&#39;t have to divide ordinary recipes for four into a meal for one person.</p><p>Delia Smith CBE is the UK&#39;s best-selling cookery author, having published over 21 million copies since her first book, How to Cheat at Cooking, was published in 1973.

Of a Jewish cemetery whose groundskeeper is an expert on flowers and seasons of the year, but no expert on buried Jews; of Russian shirts embroidered in the colors of love and death; of Jerusalem, the city where everything sails: the flags, the prayer shawls, the caftans, the monks' robes, the kaffiyehs, and young women's dresses. The poet tenderly, mischievously, breaks open the grand diction of the revered Jewish verses and supplications and suddenly discovers the light that his own experience casts upon them. Here, the bread of memory and the circuses of forgetting, nostalgia for God and a better world, dust and heat, and tamarisk trees that stand as flight attendants for the next millennium, saying, "You can still get a seat on the third millennium before liftoff." Open Closed Open-poems at once meditative and playful, anxious and full of hope, sung in a language of biblical directness and meaning, that through the microcosm of the everyday give us the gift of the world at large.<br></p><p>In the centerpiece of <i>Open Closed Open</i>, the Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai ponders his most treasured keepsake, "a triangular fragment of stone from a Jewish graveyard destroyed / many generations ago." This object is, needless to say, more than a souvenir: throughout the zigzagging lines of "The Amen Stone," it allows Amichai to reconstruct bits and pieces of the past, "fragment to fragment, / like the resurrection of the dead, a mosaic, / a jigsaw puzzle. Child's play." The ensuing narrative leads the poet directly into his nation's history. Yet this is not merely a political but a personal resurrection, for Amichai sees himself as the stone's well-weathered counterpart, a byproduct of time. And he, too, has experienced an inevitable erosion: "Jewish History and World History / grind me between them like two grindstones / sometimes to a powder." <p> Throughout the collection, Amichai returns again and again to this convergence. In "Once I Wrote 'Now and in Other Days.' Thus Glory Passes, Thus the Psalms Pass," for example, he chronicles the destruction of Huleh swamp, an open ecosystem drained by the Israeli government during the 1950s to fight malaria and provide arable land: </p><blockquote> Now half a century later they are filling it with water again<br> because it was a mistake. Perhaps my entire life<br> I've been living a mistake<br> </blockquote> Indeed, Amichai's misgivings seem to extend to the very foundations of the modern Israeli state. Might not the "bright-colored birds" who fled the swamp "for their lives" be figures for the displaced Palestinians? Huleh, we learn, was eventually restored. But sowing the seeds of peace is as precarious an enterprise as rebuilding a fragile ecosystem. <p> Elsewhere, "My Son Was Drafted" records a father's concern and fear for his military-age child. Amichai wishes his son were joining an army without a war, where soldiers serve as decorations around monuments, where the ornate and impractical replace the camouflaged and tactical. But here, too, the father has a few spiritual heirlooms to pass on to his son, which incidentally allow him to open up yet another closed system: </p><blockquote> I would like to add two more commandments to the ten:<br> the Eleventh Commandment: "Thou shalt not change,"<br> and the Twelfth Commandment "Thou shalt change. You will change."<br> My dead father added those for me.<br> </blockquote> A man, Amichai suggests, is more pliable once he has been opened up, refreshed, newly defined. Cultures, alas, are not so flexible. But the rich language of <i>Open Closed Open</i>, which has been meticulously translated by Chana Bloch and Chana Kronfeld, holds out the hope that nations, too, might submit to the Twelfth Commandment. <i>--Ryan Kuykendall</i>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2000, 0-15-100378-5<br></p><h2>Retreat, Hell!: A corps Novel</h2><p>In the fall of 1950, the U.S. Marines confront an uphill battle as they make their way from Inchon across the 38th parallel, dealing with the full force of Chinese military might, an escalating confrontation between General MacArthur and President Truman, and the disappearance of Brigadier General Pickering&#39;s pilot son behind enemy lines, in a story about the Korean War. 300,000 first printing.</p><p>W.E.B. Griffin is the author of six bestselling series.Megaseller Griffin (Honor Bound; Brotherhood of War; Men at War) musters another solid entry in his series chronicling the history of the U.S. Marines, now engaged in the Korean War. Gen. Douglas MacArthur, nicknamed El Supremo by his subordinates, is taken by surprise when the North Korean Army surges south across the 38th parallel. After early losses, he rallies his troops and stems the tide, but not for long. Intertwining stories of literally an army of characters reveal how MacArthur and his sycophantic staff overlook the entire Red Chinese Army, which is massed behind the Yalu River and about to enter the war. Brig. Gen. Fleming Pickering attempts to mediate the ongoing battles between feisty, give-'em-hell Harry Truman and the haughty MacArthur, while worrying about his pilot son, Malcolm "Pick" Pickering, who has been shot down behind enemy lines. The introduction of the Sikorsky H-19A helicopter into the war by Maj. Kenneth "Killer" McCoy and sidekick Master Gunner Ernie Zimmerman details the invention of tactics that will become commonplace in Vietnam. Readers looking for guts and glory military action will be disappointed, as barely a shot is fired in anger, but fans of Griffin's work understand that the pleasures are in the construction of a complex, big-picture history of war down to its smallest details: "There were two men in the rear seat, both of them wearing fur-collared zippered leather jackets officially known as Jacket, Flyers, Intermediate Type G-1."

Described here are the emotionally disturbed architectural plan for a palace of emptiness; the experience of snowfall in a bed in the middle of a Finnish forest; the memory chambers that fuel the marvelous futility of the endeavor to write; the beautiful woodland church, built of warm air currents and fog, scattering in storms and taking renewed shape at dusk, that gives this book its title. <i>The Cathedral of Mist</i> offers the sort of ethereal narratives that might have come from the pen of a sorrowful, distinctly Belgian Italo Calvino.

This picture book of 15 Christmas carols looks like a gift book, but cat lovers who don't find a copy under the tree will enjoy checking it out of the library. Each left-hand page contains the words of a Christmas carol, framed by a decorative border. On the right, the same border appears around a colorful, lifelike painting of cats in a setting suggested by the song. "Away in a Manger" shows a barn cat watching her three kittens curled up in the hay, and "Ding! Dong! Merrily on High" features a kitten reaching up to jingle the bells in a window. Although a few selections are distinctively English, most of the carols are familiar to Americans as well, and that's good, since the book includes no music. Ivory's distinctive cat paintings, known to readers of her <i>Birthday Cat</i> (1993) and Eisler's <i>Cat Knows Best</i> (1988), here take on a distinctly Pre-Raphaelite flavor in motifs as well as colors and patterns. An unusual (and largely successful) combination of cats and carols. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>The Metamorphoses</h2><p>Bringing together a series of ingeniously linked myths and legends, Ovid&#39;s deliciously witty and poignant Metamorphoses describes a magical world in which men and women are transformed - often by love - into flowers, trees, animals, stones and stars.

A compelling adaptation that used imagery familiar to English sixteenth-century society, it powerfully influenced Spenser, Shakespeare and the character of Elizabethan literature.</p><p>Ovid (43 BC - AD 18) was a Roman poet who experimented in a variety of different forms from love elegies to mock didactic verse.

Though the incident was mentioned in Jon Friedman's House of Cards (Putnam, 1992), Burrough's insight into the culture clash between the parties gives fascinating dimension to a story that spans almost a decade and involves unsavory players in the affairs of a multinational corporation.

The author sets out not to give us the history of academic discipline but a history of choices: the choice of pasts, and the ways they have been demarcated, investigated, presented and even sometimes learned from as they have changed according to political, religious, cultural, and (often most important) partisan and patriotic circumstances. Burrow aims, as well, to change our perceptions of the crucial turning points in the history of history, allowing the ideas that historians have had about both their own times and their founding civilizations to emerge with unexpected freshness.<br><br>Burrow argues that looking at the history of history is one of the most interesting ways we have to understand the past. Certainly, this volume stands alone in its ambition, scale and fascination.</p><p>John Burrow was Professor of Intellectual History at the University of Sussex before becoming Professor of European Thought at Oxford. His earlier books include <i>Evolution and Society: A</i> <i>Study in Victorian Social Theory</i>; <i>A Liberal Descent: Victorian Historians and the English Past, </i>which won the Wolfson Prize for History; <i>Gibbon; </i>and <i>The Crisis of Reason: European Thought, 1848&#x2013;1914. </i>He is a Fellow of the British Academy; an Emeritus Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford; and in 2008 will be Distinguished Visiting Fellow at Williams College in Massachusetts.Herodotus: The Great Invasion and the Historian's Task<br><br>As was to become customary, at the beginning of his work Herodotus tells us why he wrote it. It was, he says, "so that human achievements may not become forgotten in time, and great and marvellous deeds--some displayed by Greeks, some by barbarians--may not be without their glory; and especially to show why the two peoples fought with each other." In other words his history was a monument, a marker set down against the oblivion with which time threatens all human deeds. He was successful beyond all reasonable expectation. We are still reading his account of his great theme, the invasion of Greece two and a half thousand years ago, and a mere half century before he wrote it, by the Persian Great King and the immense polyglot army drawn from all parts of his empire. Herodotus also promises a little later (<i>Histories</i>, I.95) to tell us how the Persians under their ruler Cyrus (the Great) won their predominant position in Asia, and this promise too he fulfils before going on to his account of the invasion of Greece.<br><br>One point in his initial statement which is worth pausing on is the reference to recording the great deeds of barbarians (i.e. non-Greeks) as well as Greeks. We should look in vain in the Egyptian and Babylonian records for such even-handedness. What we are reminded of is Homer, who, as Herodotus soon reminds us, had written of an earlier conflict between Greeks and an Asiatic people. Homer allows his readers/hearers to sympathize with Trojans as well as Greeks, and as much or more with Priam and Hector as with Achilles and Agamemnon. Herodotus does not comment on this feature in Homer, but seems to take it for granted. He accepts, of course, the historicity of the Trojan War, though he thinks that Homer, as a poet, shaped his narrative to his epic purpose, and he is willing to correct him from his own inquiries among the Persians and Egyptians and by his own common sense: Helen could not have been in Troy during the siege, because the Trojans would have handed her back if they could (II.120). Herodotus has a pretty good idea when Homer lived, placing it some four hundred years before his own time, which is the mid fifth century bc.<br><br>But far more important than Herodotus' acceptance of the basic historicity of the Homeric poems is their existence, for all Greeks, as a narrative model. When Herodotus in his preamble speaks of writing to preserve great and marvellous deeds from oblivion and giving them their deserved glory, he can hardly be unaware of stretching out a hand to the Homeric epic, which purports to do precisely that. Herodotus' narrative of the great conflict sometimes carries Homeric echoes which we shall have to consider, but more generally the pacing of the narrative, the immediacy of its re-enactments of events and presentation of character, its humanity and its inclusion of the earthy and mundane--more than in Thucydides and historiography subsequent to him--all invite the adjective "Homeric." It is, however, Homeric on a vast scale, and therefore looser and deliberately digressive, as well as based on painstaking inquiries, sometimes requiring suspension of judgement, all of which is alien to the epic tradition. Herodotus is a garrulous, highly personal and conversational writer, with no aversion to the first person; one meets him face to face, as it were, so that it is not difficult to imagine the readings he gave in Athens by which his work was apparently first made public. We know his opinions, and hear of his travels, the wonders he has seen, the stories told to him, and his not infrequent scepticism about them. We can even reconstruct a good deal of his religious views, though here he is sometimes reticent. He is almost as personal a writer as Montaigne.<br><br>He was born, apparently around the mid-480s bc, in the Greek colony of Halicarnassus on the eastern side of the Aegean, so he belonged to that part of the Greek world transplanted to Asia. As the disputed borderland of Greece and the Persian empire, this area was to play a significant part in his history. Since the territory had recently been incorporated in the Persian empire, Herodotus was born technically a subject of the Great King. Though there is ultimately no doubt where his sympathies lie, and it seems he could speak only Greek, he never speaks of the Persians with contempt and has no difficulty in making his narrative identify with them as required. Though he travelled extensively--the extent has been questioned by some--and later apparently migrated to Athens, where he is said to have been a friend of the tragic dramatist Sophocles, it is surely appropriate that a man of such cosmopolitanism should have been born not only in an area which had seen Greek intellectual life hitherto most vigorously flourishing but at the interface of two great cultures, and pretty much at the centre of the known world. The date of his death is not certain, but it is clear that he lived into the period of the Peloponnesian War, i.e. at least beyond 430 bc. He is therefore, according to the best estimates, a generation earlier than Thucydides, though a contemporary, measured by the dates of their respective births and deaths.<br><br>Herodotus lists some early instances of friction between Europe and Asia--mythic or legendary--including the voyage of Jason and his Argonauts to Colchis, on the Black Sea, and the theft of the Golden Fleece. Then he rapidly advances to historical times, with the Persian conquest of the Hellenized kingdom of Lydia, in what is now western Turkey, under its king Croesus. Croesus, who plays a large part in Book I (the division into nine books is not original), is the first historical character to appear. Overthrown as a ruler, so that his career vindicates the wise saying of the Athenian Solon that no man can be called happy till he is dead, Croesus, made wise by his reversal of fortune, becomes the counsellor of his conqueror, the Persian king Cyrus. We are also told of the legendary youth of Cyrus, who was saved by a shepherd from exposure as a baby (I.108-17), and of the supplanting of the ruling Medes by the Persians under him. Cyrus then goes on to overthrow Babylon (539 bc), of whose customs Herodotus provides a description (I.192-200), after giving the reader a kind of conducted tour of the city.<br>The great wall I have described is the chief armour of the city; but there is a second one within it, hardly less strong though narrower. There is a fortress in the middle of each half of the city [i.e. as divided by the river]: in one the royal palace surrounded by a wall of great strength, in the other the temple of Bel, the Babylonian Zeus. The temple is a square building, two furlongs each way, with bronze gates, and was still in existence in my time; it has a solid central tower, one furlong square, with a second erected on top of it and then a third, and so on up to eight. All eight towers can be climbed by a spiral way running round the outside, and about half-way up there are seats and a shelter for those who make the ascent to rest on. On the summit of the topmost tower stands a great temple with a fine large couch in it, richly covered, and a golden table beside it. The shrine contains no image and no one spends the night there except, as the Chaldaeans who are the priests of Bel say, one Assyrian woman, all alone, whoever it may be that the god has chosen. The Chaldaeans also say--though I do not believe them--that the god enters the temple in person and takes his rest upon the bed. There is a similar story told by the Egyptians at Thebes . . . (I.178-86)<br>When Herodotus visited Babylon it was approximately a century since the city had fallen to Cyrus.<br><br>Herodotus' next three books deal with the further expansion of the Persian empire into Asia under Cyrus' son Cambyses and his successor Darius. It is Darius who makes the first incursion into Europe, his army being turned back by the Athenian victory at Marathon (490 bc) (VI.110-17). But overall the advance of the Persian empire seems unstoppable as, after swallowing the Greek colonies and the Hellenized kingdoms of western Asia, it advances to the limits of the known world. It comes to include not only the ancient civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia but the barely explored territories of Libya and Ethiopia and the nomads of the Arabian desert and the northern steppes. The effect is similar to that achieved by Edward Gibbon more than two thousand years later in his <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>, as he successively introduces the peoples who will overwhelm the Roman world.<br><br>Herodotus, in Books II to IV, follows the tide of Persian conquest by giving geographical and ethnographic surveys of the conquered lands and peoples. These surveys make up a substantial part of his work, and we shall need to return to them later. As a preamble to the great invasion of Greece under the Persian king Xerxes, the Persian world domination, as it seems, is made visible in the great muster of the composite army that Xerxes assembles, which Herodotus describes in detail, identifying each people in the review, with its distinctive appearance, clothing and weapons, beginning with the Persians themselves. The descriptions, and that of the accompanying fleet (VII.61-100), are too long for anything but a representative excerpt:<br>The Assyrians were equipped with bronze helmets made in a complicated barbarian way which is hard to describe, shields, spears, daggers (like the Egyptian ones), wooden clubs studded with iron, and linen corslets . . . The Indians were dressed in cotton; they carried cane bows and cane arrows tipped with iron, and marched under the command of Pharnazathres, the son of Artabates . . . Then there were the Caspians and the Sarangians, the former commanded by Ariomardus, the brother of Artyphius, dressed in leather jackets and armed with the <i>acinaces</i> [Persian short sword] and the cane bow of their country . . .<br>And so it goes on, with the Arabians, the Ethiopians ("in their leopard skins ...</p><h2>Sweet Tooth Vol. 2: In Captivity</h2><p>Following on the heels of THE NOBODY, his Vertigo graphic novel debut, writer/artist Jeff Lemire pens his very first ongoing series SWEET TOOTH. A cross between Bambi and Cormac McCarthy&#39;s The Road, SWEET TOOTH tells the story of Gus, a rare new breed of human/animal hybrid children, has been raised in isolation following an inexplicable pandemic that struck a decade earlier. Now, with the death of his father he&#39;s left to fend for himself . . . until he meets a hulking drifter named Jepperd who promises to help him. Jepperd and Gus set out on a post-apocalyptic journey into the devastated American landscape to find &#39;The Preserve&#39; a refuge for hybrids. In this second volume, Lemire explores the heartbreaking story of Jeppard and how he went from a devoted husband to the ruthless mercenary he is now. Meanwhile, Gus is captured in a camp with other hybrid creatures where he meets Dr. Singh, a scientist studying the plague that&#39;s wiped out so much of the world. By traveling more into Gus&#39; past, Singh will learn more about the plague, as well as clues at how some of it might relate to Gus and his father.</p><p>Jeff Lemire is the creator of the acclaimed <i>Essex County Trilogy</i>, the Vertigo graphic novel <i>The Nobody</i>, and is the winner of a Xeric Award and YALSA Alex Award. He is currently the writer for DC Comics' <i>Animal Man, Frankenstein: Agent Of S.H.A.D.E.,</i> and Vertigo/DC's <i>Sweet Tooth</i>. He has also previously written the Eisner-nominated <i>Superboy</i>.The second arc of Lemire&#x2019;s series continues to wear its influences (The Road, The Stand, Mad Max, Y: The Last Man) proudly on its flanneled sleeve, though Lemire&#x2019;s skillful storytelling ensures that nothing feels derivative. While boy-deer Gus gets poked, prodded, and hypnotized by people looking to understand the global pandemic that tore society to shreds and caused children to be born as human-animal hybrids, we learn a bit about what drove the brutish Jeppard to deliver the boy to captivity. In Lemire&#x2019;s burly, chiseled artwork, a tiny tweak in Jeppard&#x2019;s steely glare speaks volumes, and the sweetness behind Gus&#x2019; dazed expressions gets sharper by the page. --Ian Chipman</p><h2>Lincoln&#39;s Dreams</h2><p>"A novel of classical proportions and virtues...humane and moving."&#x2013;<i>The Washington Post Book World<br><br></i>"A love story on more than one level, and Ms. Willis does justice to them all. It was only toward the end of the book that I realized how much tension had been generated, how engrossed I was in the characters, how much I cared about their fates."&#x2013;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>For Jeff Johnston, a young historical reseacher for a Civil War novelist, reality is redefined on a bitter cold night near the close of a lingering winter. He meets Annie, an intense and lovely young woman suffering from vivid, intense nightmares. Haunted by the dreamer and her unrelenting dreams, Jeff leads Annie on an emotional odyssey through the heartland of the Civil War in search of a cure. On long-silenced battlefields their relationship blossoms&#x2013;two obsessed lovers linked by unbreakable chains of history, torn by a duty that could destroy them both. Suspenseful, moving, and highly compelling, <b><i>Lincoln&#x2019;s Dreams</i></b> is a novel of rare imaginative power.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Connie Willis has won six Nebula and Six Hugo Awards (more than any other science fiction writer) and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for her first novel, <b>Lincoln's Dreams</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her novel <b>Doomsday Book</b> won both the Nebula and Hugo Awards, and her first short-story collection, <b>Fire Watch</b>, was a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her other works include <b>Bellwether</b>, <b>Impossible Things</b>, <b>Remake</b>, and <b>Uncharted Territory.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Willis lives in Greeley, Colorado, with her family.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i>As a researcher for a popular historical novelist, Jeff Johnston finds himself immersed in the minutiae of the Civil War, tracking down the name of a general's favorite horse or the spot where Lincoln's son was buried. His meeting with Annie, the patient of old friend Dr. Richard Madison, changes his perspective. While the novelist contemplates a book on Lincoln's prophetic dreams and consults sleep specialist Madison, Jeff discovers that Annie is having vivid, horrible dreams of the Civil War containing details she couldn't possibly know. The point of view is unmistakably that of defeated Confederate leader Robert E. Lee. Jeff tries to shield Annie from the opportunistic reach of both novelist and doctor, but he can't protect her from herself, for she feels duty bound to refight the war if it will finally allow Lee some measure of peace. This charming, unpredictable book, with its unforced subtext of more recent wars and their veterans' lingering bad dreams, is an impressive first novel from a talented writer whose short stories have already won acclaim. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Conscience of a Liberal</h2><p><p><strong>This wholly original new work by the best-selling author of <em>The Great Unraveling</em> challenges America to reclaim the values that made it great.</strong></p> With this major new volume, Paul Krugman, today's most widely read economist, studies the past eighty years of American history, from the reforms that tamed the harsh inequality of the Gilded Age to the unraveling of that achievement and the reemergence of immense economic and political inequality since the 1970s. Seeking to understand both what happened to middle-class America and what it will take to achieve a "new New Deal," Krugman has created his finest book to date, a work that weaves together a nuanced account of three generations of history with sharp political, social, and economic analysis. This book, written with Krugman's trademark ability to explain complex issues simply, will transform the debate about American social policy in much the same way as did John Kenneth Galbraith's deeply influential book, <em>The Affluent Society</em>.</p><p>Paul Krugman, recipient of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Economics and best-selling author, has been a columnist at The New York Times for twenty years. A Distinguished Professor at City University of New York, he resides in New York City.<i>Starred Review.</i> Economist and <i>New York Times</i> columnist Krugman's stimulating manifesto aims to galvanize today's progressives the way Barry Goldwater's <i>The Conscience of a Conservative</i> did right-wingers in 1964. Krugman's great theme is economic equality and the liberal politics that support it. America's post-war middle-class society was not the automatic product of a free-market economy, he writes, but was created... by the policies of the Roosevelt Administration. By strengthening labor unions and taxing the rich to fund redistributive programs like Social Security and Medicare, the New Deal consensus narrowed the income gap, lifted the working class out of poverty and made the economy boom. Things went awry, Krugman contends, with the Republican Party's takeover by movement conservatism, practicing a politics of deception [and] distraction to advance the interests of the wealthy. Conservative initiatives to cut taxes for the rich, dismantle social programs and demolish unions, he argues, have led to sharply rising inequality, with the incomes of the wealthiest soaring while those of most workers stagnate. Krugman's accessible, stylishly presented argument deftly combines economic data with social and political analysis; his account of the racial politics driving conservative successes is especially sharp. The result is a compelling historical defense of liberalism and a clarion call for Americans to retake control of their economic destiny. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

By the author of The Body in the Town Hall. Reprint.</p><p>7 1-hour cassettesDrawing on American sensibilities and English tradition, Dams's debut introduces widowed American sleuth Dorothy Martin, who will delight lovers of cozies set on both sides of the Atlantic. Dorothy has moved to the fictional university/ cathedral town of Sherebury, where she and her academic husband had planned to retire before his unexpected demise. After the Christmas Eve service in the Cathedral, Dorothy stumbles over the body of Canon Billings. Once she recovers her equilibrium, she finds herself feeling involved in the case and curious about the unpleasant but learned Canon, who had made more enemies than friends. He had recently argued vehemently with his young, hot-headed assistant in the library, had tried to get the choirmaster fired and was gathering evidence against the verger who was stealing from the collection plate. Dorothy charmingly insinuates herself into village life in the best Miss Marple tradition, talking to neighbors and befriending others (including widower Chief Constable Alan Nesbitt) and determinedly pursuing the killer even as she puts herself in danger. With her penchant for colorful hats, Dorothy establishes herself as a fresh, commanding?and always genteel?presence among female elder-sleuths of the '90s. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>El Beso De La Mujer Arana / Kiss of the Spider Woman (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>&#34;Kiss of the Spider Woman&#34; is a sharply provocative tale of love, victimization, and fantasy, and of the friendship that develops between two strikingly different men imprisoned together in a Latin American jail.</p><p>Kiss of the Spider Woman is an elegant novel of a jail cell and the two men that share it, a homosexual and a revolutionary.

The first unravels the tangled story of the knot garden as it transforms itself from the curious knot of Tudor times into the great embroidered layouts of the 17th century. The English landscape all but obliterated formal patterns but they emerge again with the flamboyance of the Victorian parterre. Here, fully illustrated, is the alternative history of British gardening; a story that embraces all the decorative arts. At last it is possible to see how the designs used in weaving, embroidery, carpentry, glazing and plasterwork appear again and again mirrored in the garden.</p><p>Australians Don Leevers and Lindsay Megarrity have managed to do what so many of us would like to do: up sticks and move to a warmer clime, spending our days doing what we love best - gardening. Back in 1988 they discovered Venzano in Tuscany, the last and least interesting-looking on their list of properties to view. They were instantly smitten and once they had sold up in England, embarked on what was to become a challenging project to create a home and garden in what appeared to be an inhospitable and overgrown patch of land. Set amidst the Tuscan countryside, Venzano was, and still in parts is, an ancient Etruscan ruin, its only redeeming feature being its own water supply - something rare in that arid part of North West Italy. From humble beginnings the men have created a garden paradise and in the process educated the local Italians into creating their own gardens by demonstration. The locals help to run the nursery now set up on site and a neighbour rules with a firm rod over the vegetable patch. Don is becoming a leading garden designer in Italy and Lindsay still finds time to do his RHS Gold Medal winning botanical illustrations in this peaceful setting. This account of that regeneration is by garden writer Stephanie Donaldson who has regularly visited Venzano, watching the transformation slowly take place. It is a highly personalized tale of the trials and tribulations faced by the two men as they strove to create some sort of order from the land, which until their arrival, nature had taken back as her own. Accompanied by variable photographs, occasionally mis-labelled, the book also includes a short section on dry garden plants together with cultivation details. Interspersed in the main text are tips on germination and propagation of particularly difficult plants such as Romneya coulteri. However, the real content of this book is the story of Don and Lindsay&#39;s determination to achieve the dream to which they aspired. It is an inspiration to all dream-seekers and an eye-opener to the realities such a move entails. From its first creation in Ancient times, the knot has been symbolic of love and strength. Depicted from earliest times in ceramics, mosaics, tapestries and textiles, it was eventually transposed into what we now know as knot gardens in Tudor times. Probably originating in Italy its idea was carried back to Britain via France and implemented in the various palaces and courts of the time. Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey especially were fond of knot gardens, trying to outdo both themselves and the French in their complexity. Wolsey in particular created gardens &#34;so enknotted it cannot be exprest&#34;. However, their popularity waned in the eighteenth century with the advent of the great landscape gardeners who regarded them as too fussy and they were only resurrected more than a century later in a newer form during the Victorian bedding excesses. Robin Whalley&#39;s fascinating history of these formal gardens is informative, well-researched and beautifully illustrated with both old design plans and paintings, the latter often the only reference point to be found in the archives. Anne Jennings follows on from this with the practicalities of designing and implementing your own knot garden or parterre. Regardless of a gardens size, these adaptable garden features can fit into any scale and Anne gives an in-depth look at which plants to use, for both edging and infill, together with aftercare advice. Suitable for formal, informal and contemporary gardens, the appetising photographs will whet the appetite and fire the imagination. This book, published in association with the Museum of Garden History who has a particularly attractive knot garden taken from a seventeenth century plan, is for both the garden historian and those interested in making their own special knot garden.</p><h2>Qi Gong For Beginners: Eight Easy Movements For Vibrant Health</h2><p>"Qui Gong is one of the most important movement meditation techniques.

Proper supervision, the author declares, is necessary for the development of skilled spiritual directors. By providing examples of learning experiences for spiritual directors, supervisors, and training teams, <i>Looking into the Well</i> offers an experiential approach to the art and science of spiritual direction that can be used for personal reflection as well as for group discussion and role-playing. In addition, the book offers prayer and reflection experiences, case studies, evaluation methods, and other experiences for group and individual use. Examples of verbatim conversations between directors and supervisors are also included.</p><p>Maureen Conroy, a Sister of Mercy, has educated and supervised spiritual directors for many years at the Upper Room Spiritual Center, New Jersey and Creighton University, Nebraska.

Writing his Comedy (the epithet &#39;Divine&#39; was added by later admirers) in exile from his native Florence, he aimed to address a world gone astray both morally and politically. At the same time, he sought to push back the restrictive rules which traditionally governed writing in the Italian vernacular, to produce a radically new and all-encompassing work. The Comedy tells the story of the journey of a character who is at one and the same time both Dante himself and Everyman. In The Inferno, Dante&#39;s protagonist - and his reader - is presented with a graphic vision of the dreadful consequences of sin, and encounters an all-too-human array of noble, grotesque, beguiling, ridiculous and horrific characters.</p><p>"As poetry, Mr. Zappulla's English Dante is successful--. The power of Dante's descriptive poetry should be apparent, and that is perhaps the highest compliment one can pay a translator."--<i>Washington Times</i><br><br>In this new rendition of a timeless classic, Italian scholar Elio Zappulla captures the majesty and enduring power of the <b>Inferno</b>, the first of the three canticles of Dante's <b>The Divine Comedy</b>, unarguably one of the masterpieces of world literature. Rendering Dante's terza rima into lyrical blank verse, Zappulla's translation makes accessible to the modern reader the journey of the famed Florentine poet Dante through the nine circles of hell. With Virgil at his side, the great poet descends through horrific landscapes of the damned--dark forests, boiling muck, and burning plains filled with unspeakable punishment, lamentation, and terror--depicted with gruesome detail unmatched in all literature. Richly annotated, this translation takes even the first-time reader on a truth-seeking journey whose imaginative and psychological discoveries make clear why this work persists at the heart of Western culture.<br><br>"If Dante's <b>Inferno</b> is a cautionary tale of the history of human depravity, it is also an amazingly complex narrative, treating timeless ethical themes, medieval philosophy and religion, tendentious political issues and deeply personal events."--<i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i><br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>This timeless Christian allegory has become the key with which Western civilization has sought to unlock the mystery fo its own identity. In the Inferno, the first of the Comedy&#39;s three parts, Dante is conducted by the spirit of the classical poet Virgil through the nine circles of Hell on the initial stage of his arduous journey toward God.</p><h2>The Best American Essays 2010 (The Best American Series �)</h2><p><p>The provocative and best-selling&nbsp;author Christopher Hitchens&nbsp;takes the helm of the twenty-fifth anniversary edition of this perennial favorite that is &#x201c;reliable and yet still surprising&#x2014;the best of the best&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>).</p></p><p>CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS is the author of four collections of essays. &nbsp;<br><br>ROBERT ATWAN has been the series editor of <i>The Best American Essays</i> since its inception in 1986.

Illustrations, many in color.</p><p>Written in the early '70s, <i>Golf My Way</i> is the first of the truly modern instructionals mixing physics and kinesiology with theory and technique. The writing's a little dense, but the illustrations are quite good, and some of the mental exercises nothing less than revolutionary.

They show how different cultures at different times have entwined physical capacities and mental mechanisms in order to construct a body adapted to moral ideas or social circumstances the body of a charismatic citizen or a visionary monk a mirror image of the world or a reflection of the spirit. Each volume emphasizes a particular perspective. Part 1 explores the human body&#39;s relationship to the divine, to the bestial, and to the machines that imitate or simulate it. Part 2 covers the junctures between the body&#39;s &#34;outside&#34; and &#34;inside&#34; by studying the manifestations - or production - of the soul and the expression of the emotions and, on another level, by examining the speculations inspired by cenesthesia, pain, and death. Part 3 brings into play the classical opposition between organ and function by showing how organs or bodily substances can be used to justify or challenge the way human societies function and, conversely, how political and social functions tend to make the bodies of the persons filling them the organs of a larger body - the social body or the universe as a whole.ContributorsMark Elvin, Catherine Gallagher, Fran�oise H�ritier Aug�, Julia Kristeva, William R.

She drinks, abuses drugs, spews invective, and even lights fires. At one point she learns from an Agatha Christie novel about a potent toxin contained in castor beans, and she starts poisoning her long-suffering husband. Yet until the final fire that consumes two of her children, they continue to love her and defend her to attackers. Rule tells the story with flair, conveying all of the heady feelings involved, but still the book has a flaw: Rule fails to understand the main character. When a psychiatrist testifies that the doctor is at a younger age than a toddler in her ability to process or sustain emotions, Rule writes, "That was a shocker. Could a woman with an IQ of 165 and a biting, facetious wit, a woman who had zipped through college and medical school, be a child emotionally?"Yes, she could. <i>Bitter Harvest</i> would've been a stronger book if Rule had shown us how.<b>Ann Rule</b> is a former Seattle policewoman and the author of nineteen <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including her acclaimed Crime Files volumes: <i>Empty Promises, A Rage to Kill, In the Name of Love, A Fever in the Heart, You Belong to Me, A Rose for Her Grave,</i> and <i>The End of the Dream.</i> Her eighth, all-new Crime Files collection, <i>Last Dance, Last Chance,</i> is available now from Pocket Books.

He has also written Elektra &amp; Walverine and Queen &amp; Country. Klaus Janson achieved wide recognition for his art work on the legendary Batman: The Dark Knight Returns.Alan Moore's <i>Watchmen</i> inspired a vogue for comic books that placed gaudily garbed superheroes in more true-to-life, real-world settings. Many similar series, such as <i>Astro </i>City, have been widely acclaimed, but one of the best has gone largely unheralded. <i>Gotham Central</i> focuses on Gotham City's police and their struggle to maintain order in a flagrantly corrupt burg beset by bizarre, costumed criminals. Batman himself, whom the cops mockingly call the Bat, makes only fleeting cameos as GC detectives contend with his superpowered foes. In the installments collected here, the Joker terrorizes with sniper attacks, beginning with the assassination of the mayor, and the force reopens an unresolved bombing involving the Mad Hatter and, disgraced ex-detective Harvey Bullock suspects, the Penguin. Obvious analogues to <i>Gotham Central</i> are such TV procedurals as <i>Law and Order</i> and <i>Homicide</i>.<i> </i>Like them, <i>Gotham Central</i> boasts superficial verisimilitude, hard-edged dialogue, and a large cast of precisely drawn characters.

We&#x2019;ve come to view love as being nice. Forgiving and forgetting. Yielding to the desires of others. Yet the kind of love modeled by Jesus Christ has nothing to do with manners or unconditional acceptance. Rather, it is shrewd. Disruptive. Courageous. And, as a result, socially unacceptable. In Bold Love, Dr. Dan Allender and Dr. Tremper Longman III draw out the aggressive, unrelenting, passionate power of genuine love. Far from helping you &#x201c;get along&#x201d; with others, Bold Love introduces the outlandish possibility of making a significant, life-changing impact on family, friends, coworkers-even your enemies. &#x201c;Bold love is anything by passive,&#x201d; writes Dr. Allender. &#x201c;It is unpredictable, cunning, and creative. It is a violation of the natural order of things. In many cases it will unnerve, offend, disturb, or even hurt those who are being loved. But in the end it will also compel them to deal with the internal disease that is robbing them (and others) of true beauty.&#x201d; So if it feels like you&#x2019;ve turned the other cheek so many times your head is spinning, it&#x2019;s probably time to take a second look at your practice of love.

This publication presents a firsthand account of the effects of Cuba's totalitarian government and dire economy upon its remarkably resilient population. Harvey, a National Geographic photographer for 25 years, offers 150 vividly colorful images of Havana and the countryside--including many photographs of 1950s automobiles and crumbling homes, which are common sights. These images are matched with staff writer Newhouse's historical overview, which discusses the country's rich architectural heritage, culture, and social conditions. Together these add up to a sympathetic understanding of what the island is like today. Clearly, Harvey and Newhouse were captivated by the exuberance of the Cuban people. Recommended for a wide range of readers at most public libraries.<br><i>-Joan Levin, MLS, Chicago </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.Pearl of the Antilles, crown jewel of the Spanish empire, the island of Cuba lies so enticingly close, off the coast of Florida--but, with some few exceptions, we Americans can't get there. That seems ironic, considering how close the ties between the U.S. and Cuba have been since the early days of Cuban independence and before the U.S. embargo against the Castro regime. The best most of us can do to grasp an essence of the island's taste and feel is peruse the pages of an album of truthful photographs such as this one. It is almost a cliche, and often sounds too patronizing to begin with, to make reference to Cubans' "spiritedness." But in Harvey's soul-baring photographs, backed up by Newhouse's understanding text, it becomes obvious that high spirit is indeed a national trait. Cuban spirit is tinged with poignancy, of course, given the various freedoms and materials Cubans lack; but you can't miss the strong will etched on every face, young or old, caught by the camera here. <i>Brad Hooper</i></p><h2>Almost Transparent Blue</h2><p>A youth of college age, his older mistress, friends--random friends, they might be called--living near an American military base and experimenting with drugs both hard and soft. <p>In rapidly sketched scenes gliding from the everyday real to the hallucinatory, the author has used what he himself calls his "narrative zoom lens." The novel is all but plotless, but the imagery is tellingly vivid, "the literary equivalent of genre painting," according to one critic. </p><p>The participants seem caught in their hard-rock scene, sadly unfree, having neither the will nor the energy to break away. And over all there seems to hang the heavy shadow of self-destructiveness, not only in terms of their present situation but with regard to what the future holds for them--and the question is inescapable, for human society as well? In this mirror reflecting the present, personal relations deteriorate, violence of the moment erupts, and communication inches slowly towards nullity. One asks, eventually, if the hallucinations, whatever their source, are so very far from the vague misgivings and hopeful imaginings of the man in the street. </p><p>The author coolly and unsentimentally distills from this morass a feeling of something pure and unsullied. His technique, with its lack of taboos, of moral condemnation, and of the superfluous, comes very close to the insouciance of cinema verite, in which there is also a touch of surrealism. </p><p>Representing a sharp and conscious turning away from the introspective trend of postwar Japanese literature, this work polarized critics and public alike and soon attracted international attention, a sign of winds of change, if not specifically of things to come.</p></p><p>Ryu Murakami was born in 1952.

After graduating from a local high school, where he played the drums in a band called Coelacanth, he went to an art college in Tokyo. It was while studying there that he entered his first novel, Almost Transparent Blue, in a competition for new writers. Published in 1976, the book won a major literary award and sold over a million copies. Since then, he has worked for a publishing house, presented a weekly music and interview radio program, and hosted a TV talk show. His literary output includes two collections of stories Run, Takahashi (1985) and Topaz (1988), and the novel Coin Locker Babies (1980), which made its debut in English early in 1995. His roman a clef 69 appeared in English in 1993. He has also directed four movies based on his writing, causing a sensation at an Italian film festival when Tokyo Decadence was shown there in 1992. His latest film is set in the U.S. and Cuba.I took a fragment of glass about the size of my thumbnail out of my pocket and wiped the blood off it. The little fragment with its smooth hollow reflected the brightening sky. Under the sky stretched the hospital and far away the tree-lined street and the town. The horizon of the shadowy reflected town made a delicate curving line. Its curves were the same, the same as the time I'd almost killed Lilly on the runway in the rain, that white curved line that burned for an instant with the thunder. Like the wave-filled foggy horizon of the sea, like a woman's white arm, a gentle curve. <p>All the time, since I didn't know when, I'd been surrounded by this whitish curving. </p><p>The fragment of glass with the blood on its edge, as it soaked up the dawn air, was almost transparent. </p><p>It was a boundless blue, almost transparent. I stood up, and as I walked toward my own apartment, I thought, I want to become like this glass. And then I want to reflect this smooth white curving myself. I want to show other people these splendid curves reflected in me. </p><p>The edge of the sky blurred with light, and the fragment of glass soon clouded over.

He served as a bombardier in the eighth Air Force During World War II. At the age of 48 he became one of the early Peace Corps volunteers. His first book, <i>Living Poor</i>, chronicles his four-year Peace Corps experience of living in a small fishing village in Ecuador in the 1960s. He returned to Ecuador after leaving the Peace Corps to become a farmer on the Esmeraldas River, an experience he describes in <i>The Farm on the River of Emeralds</i>. He continues to travel and live in South America.<br>All travel narratives are self-revealing to some extent, but few go as far as this one. The author was a 1960s Peace Corp Volunteer in Ecuador who stayed on in an attempt to farm. (His account of his farming experience appeared in The Farm on the River of Emeralds, LJ 7/78). When that eventually fell through, Thomsen took a trip to Rio and up the Amazon River, which is the backdrop for this book. The author is an introspective, tormented, and bitter man, and he tells us much more about his failures and his struggles to face old age (he was 63 at the time of writing this) and death than many readers will want to know. Nonetheless, he is a brilliant writer, and in the process he gives us a view of South America that balances the more conventional travel writing and political commentary generally available.<br><i>- Harold M.

So begins the most logical silliness to be found anywhere--at least since Laura Joffe Numeroff and illustrator Felicia Bond's <i>If You Give a Mouse a Cookie</i>. Readers will follow a young boy and his voracious visitor through a series of antlered antics: jam reveries and puppet shows and big messes. It all makes perfect sense, really, once you stop to think about it. What moose <i>wouldn't</i> want to borrow a sweater when it's cold outside? And why shouldn't the loose button on the sweater remind him of his grandmother? Bond's cleverly detailed, witty illustrations perfectly complement Numeroff's deadpan style. Through just a few deft words and brush strokes, the reader gets a real sense of the unique personalities of the two characters. Children will relate easily to the full-circle reasoning of the story, while picking up the concept of cause and effect. The moral of the story?

May have soft reading marks and name of the previous owner.</p><p>We tend to think of mathematics as uniquely rigorous, and of mathematicians as supremely smart. In his introduction to <i>The Mathematical Experience</i>, Gian-Carlo Rota notes that instead, "a mathematician's work is mostly a tangle of guesswork, analogy, wishful thinking and frustration, and proof ... is more often than not a way of making sure that our minds are not playing tricks." Philip Davis and Reuben Hersh discuss everything from the nature of proof to the Euclid myth, and mathematical aesthetics to non-Cantorian set theory. They make a convincing case for the idea that mathematics is not about eternal reality, but comprises "true facts about imaginary objects" and belongs among the human sciences.Phillip J. Davis is professor of applied mathematics at Brown University.</p><h2>Jesus the Bridegroom: The Greatest Love Story Ever Told</h2><p>In <i>Jesus the Bridegroom</i>, Brant Pitre once again taps into the wells of Jewish Scripture and tradition, and unlocks the secrets of what is arguably the most well-known symbol of the Christian faith: the cross of Christ. In this thrilling exploration, Pitre shows how the suffering and death of Jesus was far more than a tragic Roman execution. Instead, the Passion of Christ was the fulfillment of ancient Jewish prophecies of a<i> wedding</i>, when the God of the universe would wed himself to humankind in an everlasting nuptial covenant.<br> &nbsp;<br> To be sure, most Christians are familiar with the apostle Paul&#x2019;s teaching that Christ is the &#x2018;Bridegroom&#x2019; and the Church is the &#x2018;Bride&#x2019;. But what does this really <i>mean</i>? And what would ever possess Paul to compare the death of Christ to the love of a husband for his wife? If you would have been at the Crucifixion, with Jesus hanging there dying, is that how <i>you</i> would have described it? How could a first-century Jew like Paul, who knew how brutal Roman crucifixions were, have ever compared the execution of Jesus to a wedding? And why does he refer to this as the &#x201c;great mystery&#x201d; (Ephesians 5:32)?<br> &nbsp;<br> As Pitre shows, the key to unlocking this mystery can be found by going back to Jewish Scripture and tradition and seeing the entire history of salvation, from Mount Sinai to Mount Calvary, as <i>a divine love story</i> between Creator and creature, between God and Israel, between Christ and his bride&#x2014;a story that comes to its climax on the wood of a Roman cross.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> In the pages of <i>Jesus the Bridegroom</i>, dozens of familiar passages in the Bible&#x2014;the Exodus, the Song of Songs, the Wedding at Cana, the Woman at the Well, the Last Supper, the Crucifixion, and even the Second Coming at the End of Time&#x2014;are suddenly transformed before our eyes. Indeed, when seen in the light of Jewish Scripture and tradition, the life of Christ is nothing less than the greatest love story ever told.</p><p><b>BRANT PITRE</b> is a professor of sacred Scripture at Notre Dame Seminary in New Orleans, Louisiana. He is the author of the bestselling book Jesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist: Unlocking the Secrets of the Last Supper (2011). Dr. Pitre is an extremely enthusiastic and highly sought-after speaker who lectures regularly across the United States. He has produced dozens of Bible studies on both CD and DVD, in which he explores the biblical roots of the Catholic faith. He has also appeared on a number of Catholic radio and television shows, such as Catholic Answers Live and EWTN. He currently lives in Louisiana with his wife, Elizabeth, and their five young children.&nbsp;<b><br> Introduction<br> </b><br> What do you see when you look at a crucifix? Different people see different things. Do you see the brutal execution of an ancient Jewish man at the hands of the Roman authorities? Or the unjust punishment of a great teacher, who was tragically misunderstood by the leaders of his day? Do you see the martyrdom of the Jewish Messiah, who was killed for claiming to be &#x201c;the king of the Jews&#x201d;? Or the sacrifice of the divine Son of God, who willingly took upon himself the sins of the world?<br><br> In the first century A.D., the apostle Paul &#x2014; a former disciple of the Jewish rabbi Gamaliel &#x2014; saw all of these things. But he also saw something more in the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth. Paul saw &nbsp;<i>the love of a bridegroom for his bride</i>. In one of the most famous (and controversial) &nbsp;passages he ever penned, the apostle describes the passion and death of Jesus in terms of the love of a husband for his wife. Speaking to husbands and wives in the church at Ephesus, Paul writes these words: <br> &nbsp;<br> Wives, submit to your husbands, &nbsp;as to the Lord<i>. </i>For the hus- band is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church his body, and is himself its Savior<i>. </i>As the church submits to Christ, so let wives also submit in everything to their husbands. Husbands, love your wives, <i>as &nbsp;Christ loved &nbsp;the church &nbsp;and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing &nbsp;of water with the word, that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without &nbsp;spot or wrinkle &nbsp;or any such thing, that she might be holy and without &nbsp;blemish</i>. . . . &#x201c;For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one.&#x201d; This is a great mystery, and I mean in reference to Christ and the church. (Ephesians 5:21&#x2013;27, 32) <br> &nbsp;<br> Now, I realize that many readers &nbsp;may be thinking: <i>&#x201c;Wives &nbsp;do what?!&#x201d; </i>Why does Paul tell wives to &#x201c;submit&#x201d; to their husbands? And why do husbands apparently get off so easy, with the simple command to &#x201c;love&#x201d; their wives? Is Paul some kind of apostolic chauvinist? What in the world does he mean when he says such things?<br> &nbsp;<br> I promise to get to that later on in the book. Before we can, however, we first need to focus our attention on what lies be- hind these controversial words: Paul&#x2019;s description of Christ as a bridegroom, the Church as his bride, and the crucifixion of Jesus as the kind of ancient Jewish wedding day on which he &#x201c;loved&#x201d; her and &#x201c;gave himself &#x201d; for her. Indeed, as we will see later on, when Paul refers to the Church being &#x201c;washed&#x201d; and &#x201c;presented&#x201d; to Christ, he is describing the ancient Jewish &nbsp;bridal bath and wedding ceremony. From Paul&#x2019;s point of view, the torture and crucifixion of Jesus on Calvary was nothing less than an expres- sion of <i>spousal love</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> What are we to make of this mysterious analogy? To be sure, most Christians are familiar &nbsp;with the idea that Christ is &#x201c;the Bridegroom&#x201d; and the the Church is &#x201c;the Bride.&#x201d; But what does this really <i>mean? </i>And what would ever possess Paul to think of such a comparison? If you had been there at the foot of the bloody cross, with Jesus &nbsp;hanging there dying, is that how <i>you </i>would have described what was happening? How could a first- century Jew &nbsp;like Paul, who knew how horribly brutal Roman crucifixions were, have ever compared the execution of Jesus to the marriage between a bridegroom and his bride? Is this just an elegant metaphor? If so, why then does Paul refer to it as a &#x201c;great mystery&#x201d; (Greek <i>mysterion mega</i>) (Ephesians &nbsp;5:32)?<br> &nbsp;<br> As I hope to show in this book, it is precisely <i>because Paul was Jewish </i>that he saw the passion of Christ in this way. It is precisely because Paul knew Jewish &nbsp;Scripture and tradition that he was able to see the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth as more than just a Roman execution, an unjust martyrdom, or even the sacrifice of the Son of God. Because of his Jewish background, Paul saw the passion and death of Christ as the fulfillment of the God of Israel&#x2019;s eternal plan to wed himself to humankind in an everlast- ing marital covenant. As we will see in this book, from an ancient Jewish perspective, in its deepest mystery, all of salvation history is in fact a <i>divine love story </i>between Creator and creature, between God and Israel, a story that comes to its climax on the bloody wood of a Roman cross.<br><br> In order for us to see all of this, however, we will have to go &#x201c;back in time&#x201d; to the first century A.D. and take off our modern &#x201c;eyeglasses&#x201d; and try to see both the love of God and the pas- sion of Jesus the way the apostle Paul and other ancient Chris- tians saw them &#x2014; through ancient Jewish eyes. In other words, we will have to go back and reread the accounts of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus in light of ancient Jewish Scripture and tradition.<br><br> When we do this, we will discover that Paul is not the only person who talked this way. In the early stages of Jesus&#x2019; ministry, John the Baptist &#x2014; another first-century Jew &#x2014; refers to Jesus as &#x201c;the Bridegroom&#x201d; (John 3:29), even though Jesus has no wife. Later on, in one of his most mysterious parables, Jesus refers to himself as &#x201c;the bridegroom,&#x201d; and calls his disciples &#x201c;the sons of the bridechamber&#x201d; (Mark 2:18&#x2013;19). Moreover, the very first mir- acle Jesus &nbsp;performs takes place at a Jewish &nbsp;wedding, when he acts like a bridegroom by miraculously providing wine for the wedding party (John 2:1&#x2013;11). Most striking of all, the last days of Jesus&#x2019; life &#x2014; the Last Supper, the passion, and his crucifixion and death &#x2014; when examined through the lens of ancient Jew- ish Scripture and tradition, look mysteriously &nbsp;similar to certain aspects of an ancient Jewish wedding. According to the book of Revelation (written by yet another Jewish Christian), the world itself ends with a wedding: the eternal &#x201c;marriage supper of the Lamb&#x201d; and the unveiling of the new Jerusalem as the Bride of Christ (Revelation 19, 21). <br><br> In other words, when seen through ancient Jewish eyes, Jesus of Nazareth was more than just a teacher, or a prophet, or even the Messiah; he was <i>the bridegroom God of Israel come in the flesh. </i>As the Bridegroom Messiah, his mission was not just to teach the truth, or proclaim the kingdom, but to forgive the sinful bride of God and unite himself to her in an everlasting covenant of love. In the words of the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church:</i><br> &nbsp;The Son of God, by becoming incarnate and giving his life, has united to himself in a certain way all mankind saved by him. . . . The entire Christian life bears the mark of the spousal love of Christ and the Church. (CCC 1612, 1617) <br> &nbsp;<br> So, if you&#x2019;ve ever found yourself puzzled by the words of the apostle Paul, or if you&#x2019;ve ever wondered exactly what it means to say that Christ is &#x201c;the Bridegroom&#x201d; and the Church is his &#x201c;bride,&#x201d; or if you&#x2019;ve just wanted to understand better who Jesus was and why he was crucified, then I invite you to come along on this journey of discovery. <br><br> As we will see, by looking at the love of God and the passion of Christ through the lens of the Bridegroom Messiah, we can transform not only the way we see Jesus and his death, but also how we understand baptism, the Lord&#x2019;s Supper, marriage, virgin- ity, and even the end of the world. While many a man through- out history has jokingly described his wedding day as his funeral, Jesus of Nazareth is the only man who ever solemnly described his funeral as his wedding day. This book explains why, and what it means for who he was, why he lived, and why he died on the cross.<br><br> Before we can begin to see Jesus differently, however, we first have to go back to the beginning of the love story, and try to see God differently, through ancient Jewish eyes. <br></p><h2>Nothingness: Talk to a Stone</h2><p>Talk to a Stone is a collection of calligrap hy and writings of Tetsuzan Shinagawa, supplemented by poetr y of many other Eastern masters. &#39;</p><p></p><h2>Whiskey Distilled: A Populist Guide to the Water of Life</h2><p><b>In the populist tradition of Andrea Immer, New York City&#x2019;s first female whiskey sommelier translates today&#x2019;s hottest spirit for a new generation of imbibers</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Whiskey is in the midst of a huge renaissance.

It happened on a Saturday afternoon behind Kenny Bash&#x2019;s house. Kenny was the neighborhood troublemaker. As I sat on the hard plastic board of his rusted-out, squeaky swing set, dragging my bare feet back and forth on a patch of dirt, he handed me a plastic liter container of bright orange soda and commanded, &#x201c;Take a sip.&#x201d; After a quick swig, I gagged, and his cruel bray of adolescent laughter followed. &#x201c;Take more,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Jack.&#x201d; This was dangerous territory and I knew it.</p><p>In a panic, I hurried back home, terrified that my parents would find out about the Jack. I shoved a fistful of grass into my mouth&#x2014;I&#x2019;d heard that grass hides the smell of alcohol. When my parents didn&#x2019;t notice, I thanked my lucky stars and promised myself that I&#x2019;d never drink whiskey again.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve spent the past ten years breaking that promise.</p><p>Today I am the Director of Whiskey Education at The Flatiron Room Whiskey School in Manhattan and I teach whiskey classes there every week. I&#x2019;m also the restaurant&#x2019;s sommelier, which is a word that comes from nineteenth-century French and essentially means butler. I didn&#x2019;t sit whiskey tests to become one (there aren&#x2019;t any) nor do I mean to turn anyone off with a word that can sound pretentious. Truth is, what I do is very butlerlike: I roam the floor, serve guests, and pluck a few personal details out of them to help them find the whiskey they will love. &#x201c;What wine or cocktail do you normally drink?&#x201d; I might ask, or, &#x201c;What do you like to eat?&#x201d; Then I&#x2019;ll hunt down the perfect whiskey&#x2014;out of the thousand or so The Flatiron Room stocks&#x2014;to suit their palate. On days I&#x2019;m not at The Flatiron Room, I write about whiskey for a couple of magazines. And when I&#x2019;m not doing that, I&#x2019;m often out on the town with a friend or my husband, checking out a new cocktail bar or restaurant that serves my favorite spirit. I guess you could say I&#x2019;ve essentially built a career on drinking Jack.</p><p>In a move my colleagues and a few friends found odd, in 2012 I left my &#x201c;sweet-ass&#x201d; job as a &#x201c;whiskey ambassador&#x201d; to join The Flatiron Room and write. As an ambassador to Glenfiddich, &#x201c;world&#x2019;s number one selling single malt Scotch,&#x201d; I enjoyed dazzling perks like international travel and a corporate card that allowed me to buy a nice steak dinner for dozens at high-end strip joints and country clubs, if you&#x2019;re into that sort of thing. I can rattle off some of the best places in the United States to find hedonistic entertainment, and I&#x2019;ve played golf (badly) on famous courses like those at Turnberry in Scotland. I even climbed Kilimanjaro in Tanzania for charity during a blizzard wearing Glenfiddich-branded gear, and slept in it too, perched on the side of a cliff in a quivering tent. At each dinner, corporate function, golf tournament, charity gala, magazine interview, TV spot, fashion show, private yacht trip, private plane trip, car show, and even rodeo, my role was the same: to make my audience fall in love with whiskey. Oh, and to use Glenfiddich while doing it.</p><p>Someone asked every other night whether I &#x201c;really liked Glenfiddich&#x201d; or if there was some other whiskey I secretly drank in private. While I never admitted that I had secret lovers, I&#x2019;d be true in my answer: I chose to work as an ambassador for Glenfiddich because I liked it in the first place, not the other way around. It&#x2019;s also a brand that aficionados love for its collectibility and taste&#x2014;I stood next to a bidder at the base of the Statue of Liberty during a Glenfiddich charity auction and watched in awe as he won the bottle for close to a hundred thousand dollars. It was a good gig.</p><p>But relationships evolve. I started to feel a nagging love for bourbon, rye, Japanese whiskies, Irish whiskeys, and a bevy of other exciting spirits, and soon I needed to spend more time with them, too. So Glenfiddich and I split. Whiskey monogamy just isn&#x2019;t my thing. By the end of this book, it won&#x2019;t be yours, either.</p><p>The most important thing I&#x2019;ve learned by hosting events&#x2014;whether they&#x2019;re for a hundred corporate executives on behalf of a big whiskey company or for two guests at The Flatiron Room&#x2014;is how to talk about it. And, while speaking to thousands (yes, that&#x2019;s right, <i>thousands</i>)<i> </i>of whiskey drinkers, my goal is to demystify whiskey and answer questions like: How do you taste whiskey? What are you supposed to smell? Do you swirl whiskey like wine? Can you put ice in a whiskey? Water? What does &#x201c;small batch&#x201d; mean? Why is Johnnie Walker Blue so expensive? What is moonshine? Why does this bottle say non&#x2013;chill filtered? How do you store it? Can you make money by investing in it? Can women drink it?</p><p>Today, American whiskey sales alone top $1 billion, up from $376 million about a decade ago. Its popularity is growing faster than the good information available on the topic. And some of the advice out there is just plain off the mark. I&#x2019;ve read blogs written by brutish whiskey fans that say certain (critically acclaimed) brands aren&#x2019;t even good enough to use as a toilet cleaner, and that to drink them means you have no taste. But taste is subjective. I&#x2019;ve heard brand ambassadors explain that whiskey won&#x2019;t make you drunk, but tequila will. Nonsense. I read nosing notes on Web sites and in books that go on for as many pages as <i>Moby Dick</i>. But the truth is, most experts can realistically identify five distinct aromas. I listened to a tourist guide for a famous American whiskey distillery explain to thirty of us that all Scotch tastes like smoke. Not true. My role here, then, is to sift through all the junky information out <i>there,</i> and give you a real primer of whiskeys, so that you&#x2019;ll be able to identify bunk like a champ and become an expert yourself. You&#x2019;ll taste along the way and have fun, too.</p><p>And the Number One Question Is...?</p><p>&#x201c;How did someone like <i>you </i>[a chick] get into whiskey?&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a question asked a dozen times per day and sometimes I just don&#x2019;t feel like explaining myself&#x2014;I&#x2019;d prefer to get right into nosing and tasting. But someone like <i>me</i> needs to &#x201c;establish credibility,&#x201d; according to one CEO who attended my tasting. I resisted that advice for years, but he was right. Now I always explain my background. The result? First, guests cease fact-checking things I say with their iPhones tucked under the table, and second, I don&#x2019;t have to answer &#x201c;Do you really drink this stuff?&#x201d; after I&#x2019;ve taught a ninety-minute class.</p><p>How I Got into Whiskey</p><p>Before whiskey, there was music. As a professional solo musician for close to ten years, I poured my heart and soul into the creation of song, the rigor of touring, the passion of singing, and the pure joy of playing keyboard. I had recorded two albums, which received wildly wonderful reviews in New York City, and I was performing in front of rapidly growing audiences.</p><p>From the outside, my music career appeared wonderfully on track, but my bank account told a different story. After I&#x2019;d had one sold-out concert in New York City, an appearance on WFUV in New York, and even a European <i>Rolling Stone</i> review in anticipation of an upcoming tour, a friend (who had also just completed a European tour with a world-famous musician)&nbsp; asked me for twenty bucks because &#x201c;cash flow was tough.&#x201d; We were on the corner of Broadway and 4th Street, right next to a boarded-up Virgin Records store. I went to get money, and instead of hearing the comforting electronic patter of bills being sorted inside the ATM machine, the dreaded Funds Not Available sign flashed on the screen. We walked back to the club where we had just performed and shamelessly asked our bass-player friend to get us both&#x2014;two &#x201c;professional&#x201d; musicians&#x2014;home in his truck. The advent of new technology and iTunes had officially tossed the music world upside down, and none of us were making money anymore. What should have started looking like a lucrative (finally!) career became a barrage of confusion, record-label fights, and overall heartbreak for just about every musician I knew, including myself.</p><p>Around this same time, my husband was accepted to graduate school in Edinburgh, Scotland. We packed our stuff and left Manhattan during the fall of 2005. I very quickly went from a &#x201c;struggling musician with promise&#x201d; to a struggling musician, period. The high of an Italian performance in Rome was followed by the lows of phone calls I made begging the label to pay me what they owed. My life became an emotional roller coaster, and I was terribly homesick for the fast-paced New York life we&#x2019;d left, with my community of musicians, weekly gigs, and the easy access to recording studios. During one of my lavish pity parties, my husband turned to me and said that I <i>really</i> needed to do something. So I went out drinking.</p><p>I was hired on my first day out &#x201c;looking for something to do&#x201d; by a gentleman called Douglas McFarlane, who spoke with a chowder-thick Scottish accent and managed the Scotch Malt Whisky Society (SMWS), a private membership bar for Scotch whisky lovers. I learned about the job by reading a Help Wanted ad in a local paper and it seemed like a fun way to meet some cool people and be Scottish-y. In my experience, working in restaurants and bars immerses one quickly into a local scene and its cast of characters. That it was a whisky venue was a total bonus. I&#x2019;d discovered that I liked whiskey when I was working as a waiter at the Union Square Caf� in Manhattan. The beverage director there had conducted a few whiskey tastings to help the staff better sell the stuff and I realized that there was more to whiskey than taking a shot or mixing it with Coke.</p><p>The SMWS lives in a corner of a Harry Potter&#x2013;esque seventeenth- century green and wet stone building. Two large fireplaces flank one side of an oak-lined room. One of the employees would later show me how to wrap my fingers around panels, moldings, door frames, and windowsills to scale the periphery of the room without touching the floor, like a rock climber. That&#x2019;s what British schoolboys sometimes do, I learned. To the left of the front entrance of the room, there is an exquisite collection of whiskey, representing almost every distillery that has ever operated in Scotland. Bottles line shelves in neat rows and bartenders serve whisky from a small, shiny wooden bar. Members take their &#x201c;dram&#x201d; to one of a few long library tables and enjoy it alongside the daily paper and a tuna sandwich. When I worked there, guests at SMWS included a smattering of locals who chatted about how to salmon fish or grow brambles, and a few passing American Scotch-drinking enthusiasts on their way to play golf at places like St. Andrews.</p><p>I spent my first day at the SMWS with Doug, tasting cask-strength whisky (whisky straight out of the cask at a higher proof), playing with a miniature whisky-making model, and testing my sensory skills with a nosing kit that always sat on the bar for guests to test their sense of smell. The kit held little samples of lavender, herbs, spices, and vanilla tucked into little glass jars. Douglas&#x2019;s passion for whisky echoed my own for writing songs and performing; he talked about flavor and smell with the same fervor I talked about keyboard riffs. I was hooked&#x2014;creativity and sensuality lived in whisky making and appreciation, too. From that point on, my life would be a balancing act between two great loves.</p><p>Within a few months of my working at SMWS, Doug invited me to sit with a bunch of whisky experts to do cask tastings and discuss whether the whiskies we tried were delicious enough to bottle and sell under the SMWS label. In a strange twist of fate, one of the regular panelists backed out for a singing gig, so I took his spot. I was very nervous. I was still a student, I felt, not yet someone worthy enough to be on a judging panel.</p><p>Tasting whiskey and writing notes about it, it turns out, is a good time. I approached the task the same way I&#x2019;d sit down to write a song: without self-ridicule and with eagerness. And because I had worked in so many Manhattan restaurants with killer wine lists, I figured some of the same notes I used to describe wine to guests could also describe whiskey characteristics. I was right. Whiskey, wine, and even music share a common language or, pun intended, notes. Here are a few examples that come to mind: &#x201c;vanilla&#x201d; (Barry Manilow), &#x201c;honeyed&#x201d; (Ella Fitzgerald), &#x201c;complex&#x201d; (Bob Dylan), &#x201c;rich&#x201d; (Adele), &#x201c;fresh and thin&#x201d; (Taylor Swift), &#x201c;bold&#x201d; (Eminem), and &#x201c;smoky&#x201d; (Peggy Lee).</p><p>So there you have it. I honed my whiskey chops by both channeling my passion for music into it and capitalizing on a wine vocabulary amassed from years of restaurant work.</p><p>A Note for You Wine Lovers</p><p>I make comparisons between whiskey and wine throughout the book because I know many of you come to whiskey with a working knowledge of the wine world. I see this in my classes and in the type of questions I get, like &#x201c;What vintage is particularly good for whiskey?&#x201d; Pascaline Lepeltier, a skilled sommelier who runs what <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> called th...</p></p><h2>John Gould&#39;s Hummingbirds</h2><p>The complete text and original color plates of one of the great classic works on hummingbirds by one of the nineteenth century&#39;s most noted European ornithological artists</p><p></p><h2>Beezus and Ramona</h2><p><p>Having a little sister like four-year-old Ramona isn't always easy for Beezus Quimby. With a wild imagination, disregard for order, and an appetite for chaos, Ramona makes it hard for Beezus to be the responsible older sister she knows she ought to be...especially when Ramona threatens to ruin Beezus's birthday party. Newbery Medal winner Beverly Cleary delivers a humorous tale of the ups and downs of sisterhood. Both the younger <em>and</em> older siblings of the family will enjoy this book. </p><p>Supports the Common Core State Standards</p></p><p>Nine-year-old Beezus Quimby has her hands full with her little sister, Ramona. Sure, other people have little sisters that bother them sometimes, but is there anyone in the world like Ramona? Whether she's taking one bite out of every apple in a box or secretly inviting 15 other 4-year-olds to the house for a party, Ramona is always making trouble--and getting all the attention. Every big sister can relate to the trials and tribulations Beezus must endure. Old enough to be expected to take responsibility for her little sister, yet young enough to be mortified by every embarrassing plight the precocious preschooler gets them into, Beezus is constantly struggling with her mixed-up feelings about the exasperating Ramona. <p> There's no one in the world like Beverly Cleary, either. This terrifically popular author of over two dozen children's books has withstood the test of time for generations, as her many awards, including the Newbery Medal, attest. Two books in the Ramona series, <i>Ramona and Her Father</i> and <i>Ramona Quimby, Age 8</i>, were also named Newbery Honor Books.

Sometimes Beezus doesn't like Ramona, but the girls are sisters and that means they will always love each other&#x2014;just not every single minute.</p></p><h2>The Calculus Wars: Newton, Leibniz, and the Greatest Mathematical Clash of All Time</h2><p>Now regarded as the bane of many college students&#x2019; existence, calculus was one of the most important mathematical innovations of the seventeenth century. But a dispute over its discovery sewed the seeds of discontent between two of the greatest scientific giants of all time &#x2014; Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. <br><br>Today Newton and Leibniz are generally considered the twin independent inventors of calculus, and they are both credited with giving mathematics its greatest push forward since the time of the Greeks. Had they known each other under different circumstances, they might have been friends. But in their own lifetimes, the joint glory of calculus was not enough for either and each declared war against the other, openly and in secret.<br><br>This long and bitter dispute has been swept under the carpet by historians &#x2014; perhaps because it reveals Newton and Leibniz in their worst light &#x2014; but <i>The Calculus Wars</i> tells the full story in narrative form for the first time. This vibrant and gripping scientific potboiler ultimately exposes how these twin mathematical giants were brilliant, proud, at times mad and, in the end, completely human.<br></p><p>Jason Socrates Bardi obtained graduate degrees in molecular biophysics (M.A., 1998) and science writing (M.A., 2001) from Johns Hopkins University, and has since worked as a professional science writer for a number of companies, government agencies, and private institutions. He spent a year as a writer at NASA&#39;s Goddard Space Flight Center, five years as the senior science writer at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, CA, and is currently a writer and editor at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD.Those interested in a lucid, nontechnical account of the battle between Isaac Newton (1642&#x2013;1727) and German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646&#x2013;1716) over who invented calculus will welcome science writer and debut author Bardi's cautionary tale. As early as 1665, Newton composed a manuscript detailing his method of calculus with examples, but after his unpleasant experience with a 1672 paper on optics that aroused the ire of Robert Hooke, an eminent member of the Royal Society who accused the younger man of plagiarism, Newton became shy of publishing. Between 1672 and 1676, Leibniz independently discovered calculus, using notation that has since become standard. When Leibniz published his results, Newton's allies rushed to discredit Leibniz in what developed, in Bardi's words, into "the greatest intellectual property debate of all time." While a few personal asides might better have been put in the preface, Bardi provides a timeless lesson about human pride as he describes the series of misunderstandings and miscommunications that led to the clash between these two great minds, "perhaps the greatest of their day."

P. Cavafy; and two collections of essays, <i>How Beautiful It Is and How Easily It Can Be Broken</i> and <i>Waiting for the Barbarians. </i>He teaches literature at Bard College.<p>&#x201c;Rich, vivid, a blood-warm book . . . a deeply moving tale of a father and son&#x2019;s transformative journey in reading&#x2014;and reliving&#x2014;the&nbsp;<i>Odyssey.&nbsp;</i>Mendelsohn wears his learning lightly yet superbly. What catches you off guard about this memoir is how moving it is: it has many things to say not only about Homer&#x2019;s epic poem, but about fathers and sons. Mendelsohn has written a book that&#x2019;s accessible to nearly any curious reader. The book partakes of at least four genres: classroom drama; travel writing; biographical memoir; literary criticism. Revealing and funny . . . Mendelsohn makes Homer&#x2019;s epic shine in your mind.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Dwight Garner,&nbsp;<i>The New York Times<br> </i></b><i><br> </i>&#x201c;My favorite classicist once again combines meticulous literary investigation with warm and wrenching human emotion&#x2014;books like these are why I love reading.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Lee Child</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;When Daniel Mendelsohn&#x2019;s mathematician father lands in his son&#x2019;s Homer seminar at Bard, the older man sets in motion an odyssey both hilarious and heartfelt. Father and son start in the pages of an epic, board a ship to follow the hero&#x2019;s path through the Mediterranean, and&nbsp;finally end where all our stories do.&nbsp;<i>An Odyssey</i>&nbsp;melds genius-level lit crit with gut-level moving memoir. Beautiful and wise.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Mary Karr</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tender . . . complex and moving: a book that has much to say about fathers and sons. On one level,&nbsp;<i>An Odyssey&nbsp;</i>elegantly retells the story of Mendelsohn&#x2019;s Odyssey course, complete with all the gags, competition, and good cheer of an intergenerational bromance. [But] it dives deeper, excavating a portrait of Mendelsohn&#x2019;s special student, his father: his lonely childhood, his early brilliance, his forfeiture of Latin for a life of numbers. Why a man so warm could be so cold. As Mendelsohn unpeels the layers of his father&#x2019;s life and education, he dramatizes the beauty&#x2014;and tedium&#x2014;of the classroom. The reality of instruction is messy; Mendelsohn happily shows us how difficult the transference of passion can be. In this way, the students become supporting characters to the book&#x2019;s hero, Mendelsohn&#x2019;s father, who lurks in the corner like a hero in disguise. There is but one ending to the book; within a year, Jay would die, and so Mendelsohn&#x2019;s journey&#x2014;indeed like Homer&#x2019;s&#x2014;would be undertaken after the fact, when something remained to be learned. It is a remarkable feat of narration that such a forbiddingly erudite writer can show us how necessary this education is, how provisional, how frightening, how comforting.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;John Freeman,&nbsp;<i>The Boston Globe&nbsp;</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;By turns family memoir, brilliant literary criticism, and a narrative of education. Most of all, <i>An Odyssey</i> is a love story. Mendelsohn makes his way through the text of the <i>Odyssey</i>, but also tells a larger, personal story&#x2014;of his family. Both odysseys focus on quests, recognitions, homecomings. The book asks: How can you really know anyone else? A truth everywhere acknowledged in Mendelsohn&#x2019;s odyssey is that everyone has a story, just as every hero has a flaw, and that everyone needs stories to get through life. Mendelsohn is the professor every college kid dreams about: learned, sympathetic, encouraging and challenging in equal measure. Like Homer, Mendelsohn makes us grateful for journeys, and the companions&#x2014;especially our families&#x2014;who accompany us along our individual and collective paths. . . . In <i>An Odyssey, </i>he reels us in with a storyteller&#x2019;s strongest gifts: passion, clarity, and timing.&#x201d;<b> &#x2014;Willard Spiegelman, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br> &#x201c;Fascinating. . . intensely moving. There are many moments to cherish in this tangled and passionate investigation. Mendelsohn&#x2019;s exploration is [both] a personal family memoir and a critical report on Homer&#x2019;s epic, and the two facets illuminate each other. Mendelsohn is an imaginative teacher, and the discussion of the <i>Odyssey </i>sparkles. The Mediterranean cruise that father and son take pays off in surprising ways; we get a haunting glimpse of the fear that the end of your journey means <i>finis</i>, the hope residual in permanent postponement. Best of all are the various small recognitions that combine to build the late-blossoming intimacy between father and son. This is an honest, and loving, account of the improbable odyssey that gave them this one last deeply satisfying adventure together.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Peter Green, <i>The New York Review of Books</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Heartfelt, touching . . . a dazzlingly rich story of identity and recognition from an exacting critic and award-winning memoirist. . .When his father enrolled in Mendelsohn&#x2019;s undergraduate seminar, Mendelsohn didn&#x2019;t know his father would only have a year to live. The course, and the cruise retracing Odyssey&#x2019;s voyage to Ithaca a few months later, set in motion an emotional journey neither man could have anticipated. &nbsp;With each new foray in his oeuvre, Mendelsohn discovers deeper truths about those we think we know, including ourselves. Mendelsohn&#x2019;s intelligence glitters on the page.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Rajat Singh,&nbsp;<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b><br> <b><i><br> </i></b>&#x201c;Mendelsohn is a force. His sentences are freighted with knowledge, observation, and feeling. Both the classroom experience&#x2014;where Mendelsohn&#x2019;s father Jay serves as a counterpoint to Mendelsohn&#x2019;s sharp reading of the story&#x2014;and the boat excursion they take offer opportunities: his father slowly sheds his carapace and gives himself over to the adventure, revealing a side that we&#x2014;and his son&#x2014;may not have seen before.&nbsp;Mendelsohn is an encouraging teacher with enthusiasm and wonderful energy. But perhaps most significantly, readers come to understand him as a man with long-borne emotions, for his relationship with his father has not been the easiest. [This] father-son journey with Homer as guide [is] no buddy story, but a hard-fought, hard-won, late-life conciliation.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Peter Lewis,&nbsp;<i>Christian Science Monitor</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Fascinating . . . Mendelsohn expertly examines the&nbsp;<i>Odyssey</i>&nbsp;with depth and classical acumen, extracting meaning from even its most subtle moments. He explores [its] historical importance with the comfortable clarity of someone who has spent decades immersed in Greek literature. He details his own relationship with the ancient poem, and he culls from the narrative many insights into his own familial bonds, specifically with his father. But the most entertaining part may be the classroom scenes. By the end of the semester, Mendelsohn&#x2019;s father had become part of the class and his presence leads to a revealing and dramatic moment.&nbsp;<i>An Odyssey</i>&nbsp;is a journey worth taking.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Jonathan Russell Clark,&nbsp;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b><br> <b><i><br> </i></b>&nbsp;&#x201c;Moving . . . a surprising piece of art&#x2014;a masterful memoir of reading, teaching and learning; a book as full of twists and turns as its subject, often beautiful too. The Homeric questions about fidelity, heroism and survival are elevated from Mendelsohn&#x2019;s seminar by the relationship between the two men. This is a story of reconciling a scientist and an artist; Jay, the man of calculus, comes to influence both his son and his fellow pupils. As well as a contribution to the art of memoir, <i>An Odyssey</i> is a vivid defence of the close rereading of a classical text, the tiny questions from which bigger pictures become clear.&#x201d;<b> &#x2014;Peter Stothard, <i>The Financial Times </i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Mendelsohn is an artful storyteller whose skills are equal to the task of weaving Homer&#x2019;s poem into his own life. In this insightful, tender book, Mendelsohn gracefully marries literary criticism and memoir to describe an intellectual and personal journey that becomes one of profound discovery for both [father and son]. Most impressive are his transitions from scholarly con�sideration of &#x2018;The Odyssey&#x2019; to intimate stories of his family life, as when the class discussion flows effortlessly into a magical moment, witnessing [his father] Jay as he offers a heartbreakingly beautiful tribute to his wife... [There are] many wise lessons to be gleaned from this lovely book.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Harvey Freedenberg,&nbsp;<i>BookPage</i></b><br><br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Fascinating . . . by turns cerebral, lively and poignant. Mendelsohn has achieved an enviable renown as essayist, literary critic and author of autobiographical explorations undergirded by insights from classic texts. In Homer&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Odyssey,</i>&nbsp;Telemachus, now 20, is searching for the father he has never known; likewise, while teaching a course on the&nbsp;<i>Odyssey,</i>&nbsp;Mendelsohn discovers that the classroom becomes a way to better understand his cantankerous father. In lesser hands, this sort of parallelism would seem gimmicky, but not here. It&#x2019;s clear that Mendelsohn&#x2019;s Socratic method of teaching (via dialogue rather than lecture) forces everyone, including himself, to see things with fresh eyes. Every step of the way,&nbsp;<i>An Odyssey</i>&nbsp;charts a remarkable journey made indelible by Mendelsohn&#x2019;s elegant prose.&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Dan Cryer,&nbsp;<i>Newsday</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Rich. . . surprising, seamless. Mendelsohn is perhaps the most accessible contemporary ambassador of the classics;&nbsp;<i>An Odyssey</i>&nbsp;makes his most convincing case to date for their vital necessity.<i>&nbsp;</i>The book argues that Homer&#x2019;s classic may be, more than anything else, a family saga. &nbsp;In&nbsp;<i>An Odyssey</i>&nbsp;Mendelsohn places himself in the Telemachus role to ponder his relationship to his own father, who, like many fathers seems to have at some point drifted away. This book is as much<i>&nbsp;</i>tribute to the magic that can occur in the classroom as an unlikely tale of a father and son&#x2019;s spiritual reunion. It is an adventure in criticism and in familial reckoning, telling the story of how Daniel and his father get to know each other in the last year of his father&#x2019;s life. Mendelsohn takes us through the&nbsp;<i>Odyssey&nbsp;</i>alongside his class, meanwhile drawing comparisons between his and his father&#x2019;s journeys, and those of Odysseus and Telemachus. Mendelsohn has honed a method of mixing memoir and criticism to reflect on the problems of contemporary life through the lens of the Greek classics. What&#x2019;s remarkable is the extent to which the&nbsp;<i>Odyssey&nbsp;</i>truly does help him&#x2014;and us&#x2014;understand our lives.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Craig Morgan Teicher,&nbsp;<i>Bookforum</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2605; &#x201c;Enlightening&#x2014;engaging, gripping and deeply moving . . . Mendelsohn explores the enduring relevance of Homer&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Odyssey&nbsp;</i>through a memoir tracing the complex relationship between father and son.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Library Journal (starred review)</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Beguiling. . . in this memoir, Mendelsohn recounts a freshman class on the Odyssey he taught at Bard College with his father, an 81-year-old computer scientist, sitting in. ... Mendelsohn gradually unwraps layers of timeless meaning in the ancient Greek poem; Homeric heroes offer resonant psychological parallels to a modern family. Mendelsohn weaves trenchant literary analysis and family history into a luminous whole. A gem.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x2605; &#x201c;Sharply intelligent. . . A frequent contributor to the&nbsp;<i>New Yorker</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i>New York Times Book Review</i>, Mendelsohn is also a classics scholar. His father, a retired mathematician, had been interested in the classics during his school days and decided to continue his education by studying with his son . . . Ultimately, this book [is] about what they learn about each other&#x2014;and what they can never know about each other. The author uses a close reading of the epic to illuminate the mysteries of the human condition; he skillfully, subtly interweaves textual analysis [with] the lessons of life outside it . . . A well-told story that underscores the power of storytelling.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus</i>, starred review</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There are a handful of books that have captured the pleasure and romance of [the classics]. Donna Tartt&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Secret History&nbsp;</i>was one. This is another. What happens in this book isn&#x2019;t really its point; it&#x2019;s more about the telling than the tale. And the telling is breathtaking. Homer has a phrase for those who can speak bewitchingly: they have &#x2018;wing�d words&#x2019;. Mendelsohn has wing�d words.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Catherine Nixey,&nbsp;<i>The Times (UK)</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;A brilliant new memoir . . . richer and deeper than Mendelsohn&#x2019;s previous work. At its core, it is a funny, loving portrait of a difficult but loving parent: Mendelsohn&#x2019;s father, Jay, who is, like [the Homeric hero] Odysseus and perhaps all of us,&nbsp;<i>polytropos</i>: &#x201c;many-sided&#x201d; or &#x201c;much-turning.&#x201d; Mendelsohn sets an account of the Homeric&nbsp;<i>Odyssey</i>&nbsp;alongside a nuanced portrait of his own complicated familial and quasi-familial relationships, including a vivid picture of Mendelsohn&#x2019;s anger, anxieties and embarrassments about his father. The book shows us how his desire to become a&nbsp;classicist was shaped in part by the desire to please his father, and how he shares some of his father&#x2019;s need to be always right. Most powerfully, Mendelsohn contrasts his account of Homer with his father&#x2019;s more critical response . . . the meeting of the two perspectives leads to a far richer reading of the poem. The fault-lines mapped in the disagreements of&nbsp;father and son correspond to some of the most fascinating interpretative questions of&nbsp;<i>The Odyssey</i>&nbsp;itself. Mendelsohn is a perceptive literary critic and a self-consciously elegant writer.<i>&nbsp;An Odyssey</i>&nbsp;is a stellar contribution to the genre of memoirs about reading&#x2014;literary analysis and the personal stories are woven together in a way that feels both artful and natural. A&nbsp;thoughtful book from which non-classicists will learn a great deal about Homer.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Emily Wilson,&nbsp;<i>The Guardian&nbsp;</i>(UK)</b>&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Spellbinding . . . multi-layered, inclusive. . . With bardic capacity, Mendelsohn tells a story that is heroic in scope yet distinctly humble in manner. Mendelsohn's keen, penetrating observations plumb the micro-emotions of the several stories interwoven here. Slowly, painstakingly and with abiding, warm humor, Mendelsohn pursues reconciliation with his prickly father, who becomes a cantankerous student in Mendelsohn&#x2019;s seminar at Bard College. The book&#x2019;s magic is in moving from topic to topic, setting to setting, insight to insight, ancient to modern over what is sometimes no more than a paragraph break, and with no creaking of the narrative machinery.

Her husband drove her to work in his tan Trabant 500. The graceful old streets of<br>central Berlin still had gaps from wartime bombing, except where new concrete buildings stood up like ill-matched false teeth. Hans was thinking about his job as he drove. &#x201c;The courts serve the judges, the lawyers, the police, the government&#x2014;everyone except the victims of crime,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;This is to be expected in Western capitalist countries, but under Communism the courts ought surely to serve the people. My colleagues don&#x2019;t seem to realize that.&#x201d; Hans worked for the Ministry of Justice.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been married almost a year, and I&#x2019;ve known you for two, but<br>I&#x2019;ve never met one of your colleagues,&#x201d; Rebecca said.</p><p>&#x201c;They would bore you,&#x201d; he said immediately. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all lawyers.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Any women among them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. Not in my section, anyway.&#x201d; Hans&#x2019;s job was administration:<br>appointing judges, scheduling trials, managing courthouses. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to meet them, all the same.&#x201d;</p><p>Hans was a strong man who had learned to rein himself in. Watching him, Rebecca saw in his eyes a familiar flash of anger at her insistence. He controlled it by an effort of will. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll arrange something,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Perhaps we&#x2019;ll all go to a bar one evening.&#x201d;</p><p>Hans had been the first man Rebecca met who matched up to her father. He was confident and authoritative, but he always listened to her. He had a good job&#x2014;not many people had a car of their own in East Germany&#x2014;and men who worked in the government were usually hardline Communists, but Hans, surprisingly, shared Rebecca&#x2019;s political skepticism. Like her father he was tall, handsome, and well dressed. He was the man she had been waiting for.</p><p>Only once during their courtship had she doubted him, briefly. They had been in a minor car crash. It had been wholly the fault of the other driver, who had come out of a side street without stopping. Such things happened every day, but Hans had been mad with rage. Although the damage to the two cars was minimal, he had called the police, shown them his Ministry of Justice identity card, and had the other driver arrested for dangerous driving and taken off to jail.</p><p>Afterward he had apologized to Rebecca for losing his temper. She had been scared by his vindictiveness, and had come close to ending their relationship. But he had explained that he had not been his normal self, due to pressure at work, and she had believed him. Her faith had been justified: he had never done such a thing again.</p><p>When they had been dating for a year, and sleeping together most weekends for six months, Rebecca wondered why he did not ask her to marry him. They were not kids: she had then been twenty-eight, he thirty-three. So she had proposed to him. He had been startled, but said yes.</p><p>Now he pulled up outside her school. It was a modern building, and well equipped: the Communists were serious about education. Outside the gates, five or six older boys were standing under a tree, smoking cigarettes. Ignoring their stares, Rebecca kissed Hans on the lips. Then she got out.</p><p>The boys greeted her politely, but she felt their yearning adolescent eyes on her figure as she splashed through the puddles in the school yard.</p><p>Rebecca came from a political family. Her grandfather had been a Social Democrat member of the Reichstag, the national parliament, until Hitler came to power. Her mother had been a city councilor, also for the Social Democrats, during East Berlin&#x2019;s brief postwar period of democracy. But East Germany was a Communist tyranny now, and Rebecca saw no point in engaging in politics. So she channeled her idealism into teaching, and hoped that the next generation would be less dogmatic, more compassionate, smarter.</p><p>In the staff room she checked the emergency timetable on the notice board. Most of her classes were doubled today, two groups of pupils crammed into one room. Her subject was Russian, but she also had to teach an English class. She did not speak English, though she had picked up a smattering from her British grandmother, Maud, still feisty at seventy.</p><p>This was the second time Rebecca had been asked to teach an English class, and she began to think about a text. The first time, she had used a leaflet handed out to American soldiers, telling them how to get on with Germans: the pupils had found it hilarious, and they had learned a lot too. Today perhaps she would write on the blackboard the words of a song they knew, such as &#x201c;The Twist&#x201d;&#x2014;played all the time on American Forces Network radio&#x2014;and get them to translate it into German. It would not be a conventional lesson, but it was the best she could do.</p><p>The school was desperately short of teachers because half the staff had emigrated to West Germany, where salaries were three hundred marks a month higher and people were free. The story was the same in most schools in East Germany. And it was not just teachers. Doctors could double their earnings by moving west. Rebecca&#x2019;s mother, Carla, was head of nursing at a large East Berlin hospital, and she was tearing her hair out at the scarcity of both nurses and doctors. The story was the same in industry and even the armed forces. It was a national crisis.</p><p>As Rebecca was scribbling the lyrics of &#x201c;The Twist&#x201d; in a notebook, trying to remember the line about &#x201c;my little sis,&#x201d; the deputy head came into the staff room. Bernd Held was probably Rebecca&#x2019;s best friend outside her family. He was a slim, dark-haired man of forty, with a livid scar across his forehead where a shard of flying shrapnel had struck him while he was defending the Seelow Heights in the last days of the war. He taught physics, but he shared Rebecca&#x2019;s interest in Russian literature, and they ate their lunchtime sandwiches together a couple of times a week. &#x201c;Listen, everybody,&#x201d; Bernd said. &#x201c;Bad news, I&#x2019;m afraid. Anselm has left us.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a murmur of surprise. Anselm Weber was the head teacher. He was a loyal Communist&#x2014;heads had to be. But it seemed his principles had been overcome by the appeal of West German prosperity and liberty.</p><p>Bernd went on: &#x201c;I will be taking his place until a new head can be appointed.&#x201d; Rebecca and every other teacher in the school knew that Bernd himself should have got the job, if ability had been what counted; but Bernd was ruled out because he would not join the Socialist Unity Party, the SED&#x2014;the Communist Party in all but name.</p><p>For the same reason, Rebecca would never be a head teacher. Anselm had pleaded with her to join the party, but it was out of the question. For her it would be like checking herself into a lunatic asylum and pretending all the other inmates were sane.</p><p>As Bernd detailed the emergency arrangements, Rebecca wondered when the school would get its new head. A year from now? How long would this crisis go on? No one knew.</p><p>Before the first lesson she glanced into her pigeonhole, but it was empty. The mail had not yet arrived. Perhaps the postman had gone to West Germany, too.</p><p>The letter that would turn her life upside down was still on its way. </p><p>She taught her first class, discussing the Russian poem &#x201c;The Bronze Horseman&#x201d; with a large group seventeen and eighteen years old. This was a lesson she had given every year since she started teaching. As always, she guided the pupils to the orthodox Soviet analysis, explaining that the conflict between personal interest and public duty was resolved,<br>by Pushkin, in favor of the public.</p><p>At lunchtime she took her sandwich to the head&#x2019;s office and sat down across the big desk from Bernd. She looked at the shelf of cheap pottery busts: Marx, Lenin, and East German Communist leader Walter Ulbricht. Bernd followed her gaze and smiled. &#x201c;Anselm is a sly one,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;For years he pretended to be a true believer, and now&#x2014; zoom, he&#x2019;s off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you tempted to leave?&#x201d; Rebecca asked Bernd. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re divorced, no children&#x2014;you have no ties.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked around, as if wondering whether someone might be listening; then he shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve thought about it&#x2014;who hasn&#x2019;t?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;How about you? Your father works in West Berlin any way, doesn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. He has a factory making television sets. But my mother is determined to stay in the East. She says we must solve our problems, not run away from them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve met her. She&#x2019;s a tiger.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the truth. And the house we live in has been in her family for generations.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about your husband?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s dedicated to his job.&#x201d;<br><br></p><p>So I don&#x2019;t have to worry about losing you. Good.&#x201d; </p><p>Rebecca said: &#x201c;Bernd&#x2014;&#x201d; Then she hesitated.</p><p>&#x201c;Spit it out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can I ask you a personal question?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You left your wife because she was having an affair.&#x201d; </p><p>Bernd stiffened, but he answered: &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How did you find out?&#x201d;</p><p>Bernd winced, as if at a sudden pain.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you mind me asking?&#x201d; Rebecca said anxiously. &#x201c;Is it too personal?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mind telling you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I confronted her, and she admitted it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But what made you suspicious?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;A lot of little things&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Rebecca interrupted him. &#x201c;The phone rings, you pick it up, there&#x2019;s a silence for a few seconds, then the person at the other end hangs up.&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She went on: &#x201c;Your spouse tears a note up small and flushes the shreds down the toilet. At the weekend he&#x2019;s called to an unexpected meeting. In the evening he spends two hours writing something he won&#x2019;t show you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, dear,&#x201d; said Bernd sadly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re talking about Hans.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got a lover, hasn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d; She put down her sandwich: she had no appetite. &#x201c;Tell me honestly what you think.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>Bernd had kissed her once, four months ago, on the last day of the autumn term. They had been saying good-bye, and wishing one another a happy Christmas, and he had lightly grasped her arm, and bent his head, and kissed her lips. She had asked him not to do it again, ever, and said she would still like to be his friend; and when they had returned to school in January both had pretended it had never happened. He had even told her, a few weeks later, that he had a date with a widow his own age.</p><p>Rebecca did not want to encourage hopeless aspirations, but Bernd was the only person she could talk to, except for her family, and she did not want to worry them, not yet. &#x201c;I was so sure that Hans loved me,&#x201d; she said, and tears came to her eyes. &#x201c;And I love him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps he does love you. Some men just can&#x2019;t resist temptation.&#x201d; </p><p>Rebecca did not know whether Hans found their sex life satisfactory.</p><p>He never complained, but they made love only about once a week, which she believed to be infrequent for newlyweds. &#x201c;All I want is a family of my own, just like my mother&#x2019;s, in which everyone is loved and supported and protected,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I thought I could have that with Hans.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps you still can,&#x201d; said Bernd. &#x201c;An affair isn&#x2019;t necessarily the end of the marriage.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In the first year?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s bad, I agree.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What should I do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You must ask him about it. He may admit it, he may deny it; but he&#x2019;ll know that you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And then what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you want? Would you divorce him?&#x201d;</p><p>She shook her head. &#x201c;I would never leave. Marriage is a promise. You can&#x2019;t keep a promise only when it suits you. You have to keep it against your inclination. That&#x2019;s what it means.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I did the opposite. You must disapprove of me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t judge you or anyone else. I&#x2019;m just talking about myself. I love my husband and I want him to be faithful.&#x201d;</p><p>Bernd&#x2019;s smile was admiring but regretful. &#x201c;I hope you get your wish.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a good friend.&#x201d;</p><p>The bell rang for the first lesson of the afternoon. Rebecca stood up and put her sandwich back in its paper wrapping. She was not going to eat it, now or later, but she had a horror of throwing food away, like most people who had lived through the war. She touched her damp eyes with a handkerchief. &#x201c;Thank you for listening,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t much comfort.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, you were.&#x201d; She went out.</p><p>As she approached the classroom for the English lesson, she realized she had not worked out the lyrics to &#x201c;The Twist.&#x201d; However, she had been a teacher long enough to improvise. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s heard a record called &#x2018;The Twist&#x2019;?&#x201d; she asked loudly as she walked through the door.</p><p>They all had.</p><p>She went to the blackboard and picked up a stub of chalk. &#x201c;What are the words?&#x201d;</p><p>They all began to shout at once.</p><p>On the board she wrote: &#x201c;Come on, baby, let&#x2019;s do the Twist.&#x201d; Then she said: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that in German?&#x201d;</p><p>For a while she forgot about her troubles.</p><p>She found the letter in her pigeonhole at the midafternoon break. She carried it with her into the staff room and made a cup of instant coffee before opening it. When she read it she dropped her coffee.</p><p>The single sheet of paper was headed: &#x201c;Ministry for State Security.&#x201d; This was the official name for the secret police: the unofficial name was the Stasi. The letter came from a Sergeant Scholz, and it ordered her to present herself at his headquarters office for questioning.</p><p>Rebecca mopped up her spilled drink, apologized to her colleagues, pretended nothing was wrong, and went to the ladies&#x2019; room, where she locked herself in a cubicle. She needed to think before confiding in anyone.</p><p>Everyone in East Germany knew about these letters, and everyone dreaded receiving one. It meant she had done something wrong&#x2014; perhaps something trivial, but it had come to the attention of the watchers. She knew, from what other people said, that there was no point protesting innocence. The police attitude would be that she must be guilty of something, or why would they be questioning her? To suggest they might have made a mistake was to insult their competence, which was another crime.</p><p>Looking again, she saw that her appointment was for five this afternoon.</p><p>What had she done? Her family was deeply suspect, of course. Her father, Werner, was a capitalist, with a factory that the East German government could not touch because it was in West Berlin. Her mother, Carla, was a well-known Social Democrat. Her grandmother, Maud, was the sister of an English earl.</p><p>However, the authorities had not bothered the family for a couple of years, and Rebecca had imagined that her marriage to an official in the Justice Ministry might have gained them a ticket of respectability. Obviously not.</p><p>Had she committed any crimes? She owned a copy of George Orwell&#x2019;s anti-Communist allegory Animal Farm, which was illegal. Her kid brother, Walli, who was fifteen, played the guitar and sang American protest songs such as &#x201c;This Land Is Your Land.&#x201d; Rebecca sometimes went to West Berlin to see exhibitions of abstract painting. Communists were as conservative about art as Victorian matrons.</p><p>Washing her hands, she glanced in the mirror. She did not look scared. She had a straight nose and a strong chin and intense brown eyes. Her unruly dark hair was sharply pulled back. She was tall and statuesque, and some people found her intimidati...</p></p><h2>Cabin Fever: 20 Modern Log Cabin Quilts</h2><p><p>Don't be square&#x2015;discover exciting log cabins in varied shapes and formations!

This sequel begins some years after A City in Winter (Viking, 1996) ended. The queen, now a young woman, worries over the fate of her missing husband and watches in dismay as her kingdom is distracted and corrupted by the foolish games and amusements of the vulgar Tookisheims, a large and powerful family of Usurper supporters. After his defeat, the Usurper disappeared into the Veil of Snows, the far distant and icy mountains, and now the queen's husband has disappeared while leading an army in the same area. All signs point to the Usurper's return, and this is in fact what happens. Once again, full-page color paintings illustrate pivotal moments in the story but with one jarring note?the text specifically describes how the queen's hair had darkened from its youthful golden to a dark chesnut color, but the illustrations still show her with shimmering golden hair. The Veil of Snows is unremittingly sad, as it is told decades after the events in question by a loyal soldier who loved and guarded the queen until her untimely death at the hands of enemy soldiers. However, it ends with a ray of hope, and a definite need for a sequel, when the narrator, as an old man, sees the queen's husband and son, now fully grown, riding together at the head of a vast army descending at last from the Veil of Snows. This poignant and sophisticated fairy tale will appeal to those who enjoyed A City in Winter, and will create demand for a sequel to complete the story.?Susan L. Rogers, Chestnut Hill Academy, PA<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.The distinguished collaborators polish off a trilogy that began with Swan Lake (1989) and continued in A City in Winter (1996). Polish is the operative word; Helprin's unnamed narrator illuminates this dark, poignant story with characteristically refulgent prose, to which Van Allsburg's 13 color scenes of theatrically posed, golden-toned figures add sparkling elegance. A troubled peace follows the usurper's flight behind the remote Veil of Snows, and he soon returns to shatter the Queen's army, kill her husband (seemingly), and oppose her and her infant son with two million men. After a bitter siege, the Queen and her last 100,000 loyal followers escape the capital city and disperse into the mountains, where she is pursued and killed. Helprin injects a garishly satiric hue into this tale by filling it with corpulent, venial, opportunistic Tookisheims, a family whose government is headed by the Duke, a media mogul whose papers are relentlessly critical of the Queen, and Branco, who ``makes the talking boxes that take the place of books.'' After 25 years of waiting beside the Veil, the narrator symbolically casts away the last of his hope--just as the Queen's husband and grown son march out of the mists at the head of a new army. As with the previous books, the language, imagery, and wit are aimed at sophisticated sensibilities; Helprin's bottomless imagination and Van Allsburg's monumental visual style create a collaboration that glitters with star quality.

They're Asian longhorned beetles, pests with "powerful jaws and a taste for wood" and the frightening potential to eat their way through North American forests. Griffin takes readers alongside a team of dedicated scientists and citizen volunteers working to eradicate this invasive species in a quarantined area in Worchester County, MA. Along the way, she explains how the creatures can go undetected for years (their life cycle begins inside trees, which keeps them heavily camouflaged) and offers information that early studies on the creature have yielded&#x2014;not all of it hopeful. Abundant, close-up, color photos of the insect (from egg to pupa to mature adult), damaged trees, onsite workers, and informative labeled diagrams and maps help tell this disquieting story.

The demand for turpentine, their principal industry, has dwindled to nothing. When they are not fending off or involuntarily "supplying" Union soldiers and marauding gangs, they are hiding their sons from the macks, their hostile Confederate neighbors (pink-faced Scottish farmers with names like McTeer and McLean), who are rounding up Scuffletown boys for forced labor in forts and salt works, from which few have returned.<p> Sixteen-year-old Rhoda Strong has seen both her brothers disappear into the woods to join this gang, headed by the handsome, charismatic Henry Berry Lowrie, the hope of Scuffletown--who keeps the young men alive through a series of crimes that inevitably escalate to match the cruelties of the macks. To her mother's distress, and to her own, Rhoda finds herself falling in love with Henry Lowrie, so obviously a marked man. When he notices her, and returns her love, she too becomes marked, dubbed the Queen of Scuffletown by her enemies and drawn into a larger history of suffering and revenge. </p><p> Writing from the vantage point of middle age, Rhoda resurrects the past, "hot as coals," in an obsessive act of remembrance, having studied and pondered her story for over 20 years. </p><blockquote> One dog tooth is gone, and my monthly flow has dwindled to a spatter. I'm not as full as I used to be, my wrists are skinny, my knuckles are knobs. I'm starting to wear thin. This is the price of the years of thinking, the casting and recording of events and the frantic pen scratching past midnight, the hoarding of paper, the loneliness, the pages accumulating while I myself shrink down. </blockquote> Rhoda's richly detailed and beautifully sustained fourth novel will recall, in the best ways, Charles Frazier's <i>Cold Mountain</i> (also set in North Carolina, the most "Union" of the Confederate states), although Humphreys has given her heroine a fresh, strong voice, and in turn given a voice to Scuffletown. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Josephine Humphreys is the recipient of an Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

In the popular mind his name is associated with the mysterious Godot who may or may not come but for whom we wait anyhow. In this he seemed to define the mood of an age. But his range is wider than that, and his achievement far greater. Beckett was an artist possessed by a vision of life without consolation or dignity or promise of grace, in the face of which our only duty is not to lie to ourselves. It was a vision to which he gave expression in language of a virile strength and intellectual subtlety that marks him as one of the great prose stylists of the twentieth century." &#x2014; J. M. Coetzee, from his Introduction<br></p><p>Samuel Beckett (1906-1989), one of the leading literary and dramatic figures of the twentieth century, was born in Foxrock, Ireland and attended Trinity University in Dublin. In 1928, he visited Paris for the first time and fell in with a number of avant-garde writers and artists, including James Joyce. In 1937, he settled in Paris permanently. Beckett wrote in both English and French, though his best-known works are mostly in the latter language. A prolific writer of novels, short stories, and poetry, he is remembered principally for his works for the theater, which belong to the tradition of the Theater of the Absurd and are characterized by their minimalist approach, stripping drama to its barest elements. In 1969, Beckett was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature and commended for having &#39;transformed the destitution of man into his exaltation.&#39; Beckett died in Paris in 1989.&#34;Starting out as an uneasy Joycean and an even more uneasy Proustian, Beckett eventually settled on philosophical comedy as the medium for his uniquely anguished, arrogant, self-doubting, scrupulous temperament. In the popular mind his name is associated with the mysterious Godot who may or may not come but for whom we wait anyhow, passing the time as best we can. In this he seemed to define the mood of an age. But his range is wider than that, and his achievement far greater. Beckett was an artist possessed by a vision of life without consolation or dignity or promise of grace, in the face of which our only duty--inexplicable and futile, but a dury nonetheless--is not to lie to ourselves. It was a vision to which he gave expression in language of a virile strength and intellectual subtlety that marks him as one of the great prose stylists of the twentieth century.&#34;</p><h2>Berenice Abbott: A Life in Photography</h2><p><b>The comprehensive biography of the iconic twentieth-century American photographer Berenice Abbott, a trailblazing documentary modernist, author, and inventor.</b><br>Berenice Abbott is to American photography as Georgia O'Keeffe is to painting or Willa Cather to letters. She was a photographer of astounding innovation and artistry, a pioneer in both her personal and professional life. Abbott's sixty-year career established her not only as a master of American photography, but also as a teacher, writer, archivist, and inventor. Famously reticent in public, Abbott's fascinating life has long remained a mystery&#x2015;until now.<br>In <i>Berenice Abbott: A Life in Photography, author, archivist, and curator Julia Van Haaften brings this iconic public figure to life alongside outlandish, familiar characters from artist Man Ray to cybernetics founder Norbert Wiener. A teenage rebel from Ohio, Abbott escaped first to Greenwich Village and then to Paris&#x2015;photographing, in Sylvia Beach's words, "everyone who was anyone." As the Roaring Twenties ended, Abbott returned to New York, where she soon fell in love with art critic Elizabeth McCausland, with whom she would spend thirty years.<br>In the 1930s, Abbott began her best-known work, <em>Changing New York</em></i><em>, in which she fearlessly documented the city's metamorphosis. When warned by an older male supervisor that "nice girls" avoid the Bowery&#x2015;then Manhattan's skid row&#x2015;Abbott shot back, "I'm not a nice girl. I'm a photographer...I go anywhere." This bold, feminist attitude would characterize all Abbott's accomplishments, including imaging techniques she invented in her influential, space race-era science photography and her tenure as The New School's first photography teacher.<br>With more than ninety stunning photos, this sweeping, cinematic biography secures Berenice Abbott's place in the histories of photography and modern art, while framing her incredible accomplishments as a female artist and entrepreneur.<br>&nbsp; 92 photographs</em></p><p><b><b>NOMINATIONS = </b></b><b><b></b></b><b><b>Ohioana Book Award = </b></b>2019 ohioana.org/programs/ohioana-book-awards/<b><b></b></b><b><b></b></b><b><b>Lambda Literary = </b></b>"Lammy" finalist for Lesbian Memoir/Biography 2019 = lambdaliterary.org/lambda-literary-award-finalists/<b></b><b>PEN America</b> = Long-listed for PEN America's 2019 Bograd Weld Prize for Biography = pen.org/2019longlists/ AND @PENamerican has announced the longlist for the PEN/Bograd Weld Prize for Biography.

The author guides readers through each step, from choosing the wool through carding and spinning warp and weft yarns, building and setting up a loom, creating a design, and carrying out the actual weaving. Although the emphasis is on typical blanket weaving, the author also covers the related arts of saddleblanket weaving, warp weaving, scalloped edge weaving, double-faced weaving, and sandpainting tapestries. She also comments on history, patterns, symbolism, the effect of the market, and other matters that affect the Navajo weaving style. In five appendixes she reviews the implements and materials of weaving, Navajo materials for natural dyes, weaving terms, and simple lessons in learning to weave a Navajo blanket. Nearly 100 photographs and line drawings illustrate the processes and finished work.<br>Crafters, whether they want to start from scratch or gradually add Navajo elements to their other weaving skills, will learn from this book the authentic steps of Navajo weaving.

Why did Don Mackey, a smoke jumper who was already a legend in his own time, turn back to the fire after making his way to safety? And how could such a seasoned group of fire fighting professionals be caught off guard so badly? <p>With the aid of papers obtained through the Freedom of Information Act and dozens of interviews, <em>Fire on the Mountain</em> also takes a long, hard look at the official investigation that followed the fire and the divided conclusions of the investigative team. If this book is action/adventure at its best, it also offers deeply moving insights into the lives of the smoke jumpers, hot shots, and helitacks who fight forest fires and put their own well being on the line as a daily part of their jobs.</p></p><p>Colorado and its neighboring states battle thousands of wildfires every year, scrub and sagebrush blazes often ignited by lightning strikes in the dry, hot days of summer. A vast, intertwined firefighting infrastructure combining local resources with agencies like the Forest Service and the BLM, reacts to these flare-ups as if going to war--and in theory, the coordination and communication ensures that fires are fought in the most efficient and safe manner possible. But while most wildfires in Colorado end up costing just over $60,000 on average with no loss of life, the catastrophic South Canyon fire of 1994 burned for 10 days, at the ultimate cost of $4.5 million and the lives of 14 firefighters. OSHA would later describe the coordinated action flatly as a "management failure," and concurrent investigations would reveal a tangled web of jealous rivalries, bureaucratic bungling, and severe morale problems. (One of the early on-scene supervisors would later tell investigators, "Leadership in this state sucks.")<p> John Maclean (son of Norman Maclean, who wrote both <i>A River Runs Through It</i> and an award-winning account of Montana's deadly 1949 Mann Gulch fire) skillfully unfolds that summer's foreboding blow-by-blow. <i>Fire on the Mountain</i> weaves together a tense narrative of almost cinematic action, starring ballsy cowboy smokejumpers, frustrated federal middle managers, seasoned "hotshots" flown in like commandos, pissed-off tanker pilots, and well-intentioned but spin-wary politicians. Maclean's well-sketched personalities bring the action on the ground convincingly to life--and knowing up front that many of his main characters won't survive South Canyon makes this tragic tale that much more compelling. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><p>In 1994, a wildfire on Colorado's Storm King Mountain was wrongly identified at the outset as occurring in South Canyon.</p><p>This unintentional, seemingly minor human error was the first in a string of mistakes that would be compounded into one of the greatest tragedies in the annals of firefighting. Before it was done, fourteen courageous firefighters&#x2014;men and women, hotshots, smoke jumpers, and helicopter crew&#x2014;would lose their lives battling the deadly so-called South Canyon blaze.</p><p>John N. Maclean's award-winning national bestseller <em>Fire on the Mountain</em> is a stunning reconstruction of the killer conflagration and its aftermath&#x2014;a page-turning true adventure of nature at its most unforgiving, and a powerful, indelible portrait of a unique breed of heroes who regularly and without question place their lives on the line.</p></p><h2>Personality, Character, and Leadership In The White House: Psychologists Assess the Presidents</h2><p><i>Personality, Character, and Leadership in the White House</i> is the first book-length work to present truly scientific personality evaluations of the American presidents. This benchmark work dramatically improves the state-of-the-art in classifying presidents and predicting performance in the White House. Dr. Steven Rubenzer and Dr. Thomas Faschingbauer asked 120 experts, including biographers, historians, presidential advisers, and other knowledge-able sources, to rate the presidents by filling out standardized personality tests. For each president that fell within their area of expertise, the evaluators completed a 592-item questionnaire regarding personality, intelligence, and behavior. From the results, the authors identify nine traits related to presidential success, examine how the presidents&#x2019; personalities affected their job performance, and list their scores on the major dimensions of personality. Rubenzer and Faschingbauer provide revealing insights about every American president and profile twenty-one of them in detail, including all post&#x2013;World War II presidents and all of the &#x201c;great&#x201d; presidents. In addition to revolutionizing the way we look at the presidency, the study offers entertaining and unexpected conclusions. For instance, which recent president&#x2019;s personality and character most closely resembles those of Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln? The answer may surprise you. Presidential scholars, students, and anyone who likes to be well informed when discussing their political preferences will find this enlightening book irresistible.

(It is a mark of the unhappy that they are trapped in the present without a larger sense of connection to the enduring self.) And he argues persuasively that the successful and the fulfilled become so because of the control they exercise over this subjective temporal embodiment. At its best, <i>Time and the Art of Living</i> is a profound book with lyrically beautiful prose. <i>--Richard Farr</i></p>ROBERT GRUDIN is a professor of English at the University of Oregon.</p><h2>The Hidden Girl A True Story of the Holocaust</h2><p>After deciding to donate the dress her mother had made for her to a museum, Lola Rein Kaufman, survivor of the Nazi Holocaust, decides that it is finally time to speak publicly about her experiences.</p><p></p><h2>Savage Species: Playing Monstrous Characters (Dungeons &amp; Dragons Supplement)</h2><p><b>A New Breed of Adventurer</b><br><br>Whether wondrous or wicked, some monsters have a calling that reaches beyond the ordinary existence of their kind.

A lively text and striking illustrations provide a revelatory account of the planet's dramatic formation.</p><p>Meredith Hooper is a highly acclaimed, award-winning science writer. She lives in England.Hooper and Coady pass on a sense of wonder for the history contained in one small pebble in an outstanding picture-book overview of 480 million years. The narrator, a young girl, holds a small pebble up and asks a simple question: ``Where did you come from, pebble?'' The book flashes back to the ``beginning'' of earth history, a dramatic spread of red hot volcanoes on the earth's crust spewing forth fire and rocks. One page and 85 million years later, the earth's surface is beginning to rise and buckle, rain and snow cause cracks in the rocks, and the first living things appear on the land. Seas rise and fall, fish give way to giant amphibians, amphibians give way to dinosaurs, then furry rodents, mammoths, early man, saber-toothed tigers, farms, houses, and modern times. The text never loses track of the pebble, worn smooth by rain and wind, packed into a new layer of rock forming under the sea, pushed up into mountains as the earth tilts and folds, and carried by glaciers to the field where the girl finds it. The final page offers a chronology with charts. A note makes clear that species are not drawn to scale, and other licenses taken. Coady provides spectacular paintings, given texture, weight, and movement by the strokes of his brush. (Nonfiction. 7-12) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Peter Sis, author of the wonderful children's book <i>Follow the Dream: The Story of Christopher Columbus</i>, tells Galileo's tale for children ages 8 and older. A brilliant and sophisticated illustrator and a sensitive storyteller, he traces Galileo's life from childhood to his final days as a prisoner of the church.

Used in modest numbers at the outset, this beautiful craft was later to be developed and exploited significantly by Pan American - indeed, no airline company made more of the water-based aircraft, nor used it to greater effect, than this world-renowned company in the first twenty years of its operational life. This book is testament to that use. Through the carriage of mail and then passengers, Pan American built an ocean-crossing network using a fleet of flying-boats which became famous as the Pan American Clipper Ships. In the process of this development, aviation records were constantly set, ranging from the first airline to cross the Pacific, the first to encompass South America in its routes, and the first to offer fare-paying, scheduled services across the North Atlantic. The new service offered travelers, government officials, and even heads of state, unparalleled levels of comfort and luxury, and such innovations had to be accompanied by a good share of business acumen, promotional skill and high regard for passenger comfort. Revealing portraits are presented here of the key pioneering figures who pushed the technology ahead, and ultimately laid the foundations for the global air transport network and passenger services that we know today. The Pan Am Clipper Ships belong to one of aviation history&#39;s most inspiring and magical periods. Illustrated with over 100 archive photographs, this impressive book is a tribute to a technical wonder that continues to fascinate and captivate today and which, in its time, was the toast of international air travel.</p><p></p><h2>Miracle Power for Infinite Riches</h2><p>This book reveals the astonishing miracle power that can release a flood-tide of abundance into your life.

Containing all crafters need to know in order to produce beautiful embroideries, this references finishes with instructions on creating band samplers inspired by those on which 16th-century embroiderers collected their most prized designs, including figures, flowers, plants, birds, and animals.</p><p>Lesley Wilkins is an expert blackwork crafter whose work has appeared in &#34;Needlecraft&#34; and &#34;Needlework &#34;magazines. She is the author of &#34;Beginner&#39;s Guide to Blackwork.&#34;May 12 Blackwork was brought to England from Spain in the early 16th century by Catherine of Aragon, and this Arabic style of embroidery morphed into something more English than Spanish over the years. Wilkins (Beginner&#39;s Guide to Blackwork) introduces the basics of blackwork (e.g., selecting the appropriate thread and canvas and choosing stitches and motifs), then presents a variety of blackwork charts, including several inspired by a 1598 sampler owned by the Victoria and Albert Museum. Blackwork does not need to be sewn with black thread, and several of the patterns are quite colorful. VERDICT Crafters who cross-stitch or embroider may appreciate blackwork as well-especially if they enjoy Tudor-era motifs. * Library Journal, USA *</p><h2>Cheers!

Was the Lord Provost's daughter kidnapped or just another runaway? And why on earth is Rebus invited to a clay pigeon shoot at the home of the Scottish Office's Permanent Secretary? Drawn into the machine that is modern Scotland, Rebus confronts the fact that some of his enemies may be beyond justice. BLACK &amp; BLUE: Rebus is juggling four cases trying to nail one killer - and doing it under the scrutiny of an internal inquiry led by a man he's just accused of taking backhanders from Glasgow's Mr Big. Added to that there are TV cameras at his back investigating a miscarriage of justice, making Rebus a criminal in the eyes of millions of viewers. Just one mistake is likely to mean a slow and unpleasant death or, worse still, losing his job. THE HANGING GARDEN: DI John Rebus is on the trail of a WWII war criminal - until the running battle between two rival gangs on the city streets arrives at his door. When his daughter is the victim of a hit-and-run Rebus is forced to acknowledge that there is nothing he wouldn't do to bring down the prime suspect - even if it means cutting a deal with the devil.</p><p>Born in the Kingdom of Fife in 1960, Ian Rankin graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1982, and then spent three years writing novels when he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish Literature.

The ground was thick with fallen leaves; the horses&#x2019; hooves made little sound and it was hard to tell whether we were still on the road. A wretched track, Barak had called it earlier, grumbling yet again about the wildness of this barbarian land I had brought him to. I had not replied for I was bone-tired, my poor back sore and my legs in their heavy riding boots as stiff as boards. I was worried, too, for the strange mission that now lay close ahead was weighing on my mind. I lifted a hand from the reins and felt in my coat pocket for the Archbishop&#x2019;s seal, fingering it like a talisman and remembering Cranmer&#x2019;s promise: &#x2018;This will be safe enough, there will be no danger.&#x2019;</p><p>I had left much care behind me as well, for six days before, I had buried my father in Lichfield. Barak and I had had five days&#x2019; hard riding northwards since then, the roads in a bad state after that wet summer of 1541. We rode into wild country where many villages still consisted of the old longhouses, people and cattle crammed together in hovels of thatch and sod. We left the Great North Road that afternoon at Flaxby. Barak wanted to rest the night at an inn, but I insisted we ride on, even if it took all night. I reminded him we were late, tomorrow would be the twelfth of September and we must reach our destination well before the King arrived.</p><p>The road, though, had soon turned to mud, and as night fell we had left it for a drier track that veered to the northeast, through thick woodland and bare fields where pigs rooted among the patches of yellow stubble.</p><p>The woodland turned to forest and for hours now we had been picking our way through it. We lost the main track once and it was the Devil&#x2019;s own job to find it again in the dark. All was silent save for the whisper of fallen leaves and an occasional clatter of brushwood as a boar or wildcat fled from us. The horses, laden with panniers containing our clothes and other necessities, were as exhausted as Barak and I. I could feel Genesis&#x2019; tiredness and Sukey, Barak&#x2019;s normally energetic mare, was content to follow his slow pace.</p><p>&#x2018;We&#x2019;re lost,&#x2019; he grumbled.</p><p>&#x2018;They said at the inn to follow the main path south through the forest. Anyway, it must be daylight soon,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;Then we&#x2019;ll see where we are.&#x2019;</p><p>Barak grunted wearily. &#x2018;Feels like we&#x2019;ve ridden to Scotland. I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if we get taken for ransom.&#x2019; I did not reply, tired at his complaining, and we plodded on silently.</p><p>My mind went back to my father&#x2019;s funeral the week before. The little group of people round the grave, the coffin lowered into the earth. My cousin Bess, who had found him dead in his bed when she brought him a parcel of food.</p><p>&#x2018;I wish I had known how ill he was,&#x2019; I told her when we returned to the farm afterwards. &#x2018;It should have been me that looked after him.&#x2019;</p><p>She shook her head wearily. &#x2018;You were far away in London and we&#x2019;d not seen you for over a year.&#x2019; Her eyes had an accusing look.</p><p>&#x2018;I have had difficult times of my own, Bess. But I would have come.&#x2019;</p><p>She sighed. &#x2018;It was old William Poer dying last autumn undid him. They&#x2019;d wrestled to get a profit from the farm these last few years and he seemed to give up.&#x2019; She paused. &#x2018;I said he should contact you, but he wouldn&#x2019;t. God sends us hard trials. The droughts last summer, now the floods this year. I think he was ashamed of the money troubles he&#x2019;d got into. Then the fever took him.&#x2019;</p><p>I nodded. It had been a shock to learn that the farm where I had grown up, and which now was mine, was deep in debt. My father had been near seventy, his steward William not much younger. Their care of the land had not been all it should and the last few harvests had been poor. To get by he had taken a mortgage on the farm with a rich landowner in Lichfield. The first I knew of it was when the mortgagee wrote to me, immediately after Father&#x2019;s death, to say he doubted the value of the land would clear the debt. Like many gentry in those days he was seeking to increase his acreage for sheep, and granting mortgages to elderly farmers at exorbitant interest was one way of doing it.</p><p>&#x2018;That bloodsucker Sir Henry,&#x2019; I said bitterly to Bess.</p><p>&#x2018;What will you do? Let the estate go insolvent?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;I won&#x2019;t disgrace Father&#x2019;s name. I&#x2019;ll pay it.&#x2019; I thought, God knows I owe him that.</p><p>&#x2018;That is good.&#x2019;</p><p>I came to with a start at the sound of a protesting whicker behind me. Barak had pulled on Sukey&#x2019;s reins, bringing her to a stop. I halted too and turned uncomfortably in the saddle. His outline and that of the trees were sharper now, it was beginning to get light. He pointed in front of him. &#x2018;Look there!&#x2019;</p><p>Ahead the trees were thinning. In the distance I saw a red point of light, low in the sky.</p><p>&#x2018;There!&#x2019; I said triumphantly. &#x2018;The lamp we were told to look out for, that&#x2019;s set atop a church steeple to guide travellers. This is the Galtres Forest, like I said!&#x2019;</p><p>We rode out of the trees. A cold wind blew up from the river as the sky lightened. We wrapped our coats tighter round us and rode down, towards York.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>THE MAIN ROAD into the city was already filled with packhorses and carts loaded with food of every kind. There were enormous forester&#x2019;s carts too, whole tree-trunks dangling dangerously over their tails. Ahead the high city walls came into view, black with the smoke of hundreds of years, and beyond were the steeples of innumerable churches, all dominated by the soaring twin towers of York Minster. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s busy as Cheapside on a market-day,&#x2019; I observed.</p><p>&#x2018;All for the King&#x2019;s great retinue.&#x2019;</p><p>We rode slowly on, the throng so dense we scarce managed a walking pace. I cast sidelong glances at my companion. It was over a year now since I had taken Jack Barak on as assistant in my barrister&#x2019;s practice after his old master&#x2019;s execution. A former child of the London streets who had ended up working on dubious missions for Thomas Cromwell, he was an unlikely choice, even though he was clever and had the good fortune to be literate. Yet I had not regretted it. He had adjusted well to working for me, doggedly learning the law. No one was better at keeping witnesses to the point while preparing affidavits, or ferreting out obscure facts, and his cynical, slantwise view of the system was a useful corrective to my own enthusiasm.</p><p>These last few months, however, Barak had often seemed downcast, and sometimes would forget his place and become as oafish and mocking as when I had first met him. I feared he might be getting bored, and thought bringing him to York might rouse him out of himself. He was, though, full of a Londoner&#x2019;s prejudices against the north and northerners, and had complained and griped almost the whole way. Now he was looking dubiously around him, suspicious of everything.</p><p>Houses appeared straggling along the road and then, to our right, a high old crenellated wall over which an enormous steeple was visible. Soldiers patrolled the top of the wall, wearing iron helmets and the white tunics with a red cross of royal longbowmen. Instead of bows and arrows, though, they carried swords and fearsome pikes, and some even bore long matchlock guns. A great sound of banging and hammering came from within.</p><p>&#x2018;That must be the old St Mary&#x2019;s Abbey, where we&#x2019;ll be staying,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;Sounds like there&#x2019;s a lot of work going on to make it ready for the King.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Shall we go there now, leave our bags?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No, we should see Brother Wrenne first, then go to the castle.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;To see the prisoner?&#x2019; he asked quietly.</p><p>&#x2018;Ay.&#x2019;</p><p>Barak looked up at the walls. &#x2018;St Mary&#x2019;s is guarded well.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The King will be none too sure of his welcome, after all that&#x2019;s happened up here.&#x2019;</p><p>I had spoken softly, but the man in front of us, walking beside a packhorse laden with grain, turned and gave us a sharp look. Barak raised his eyebrows and he looked away. I wondered if he was one of the Council of the North&#x2019;s informers; they would be working overtime in York now.</p><p>&#x2018;Perhaps you should put on your lawyer&#x2019;s robe,&#x2019; Barak suggested, nodding ahead. The carts and packmen were turning into the abbey through a large gate in the wall. Just past the gate the abbey wall met the city wall at right angles, hard by a fortress-like gatehouse decorated with the York coat of arms, five white lions against a red background. More guards were posted there, holding pikes and wearing steel helmets and breastplates. Beyond the wall, the Minster towers were huge now against the grey sky.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m not fetching it out of my pack, I&#x2019;m too tired.&#x2019; I patted my coat pocket. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve got the Chamberlain&#x2019;s authority here.&#x2019; Archbishop Cranmer&#x2019;s seal was there too; but that was only to be shown to one person. I stared ahead, at something I had been told to expect yet which still made me shudder: four heads fixed to tall poles, boiled and black and half eaten by crows. I knew that twelve of the rebel conspirators arrested that spring had been executed in York, their heads and quarters set on all the city gates as a warning to others.</p><p>We halted at the end of a little queue, the horses&#x2019; heads drooping with tiredness. The guards had stopped a poorly dressed man and were questioning him roughly abou...</p></p><h2>Killing Commendatore</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

One April day, the impulse to write a novel came to him suddenly while watching a baseball game. That first novel, Hear the Wind Sing, won a new writers&#39; award and was published the following year. More followed, including A Wild Sheep Chase and Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, but it was Norwegian Wood, published in 1987, which turned Murakami from a writer into a phenomenon. His books became bestsellers, were translated into many languages, including English, and the door was thrown wide open to Murakami&#39;s unique and addictive fictional universe. Murakami writes with admirable discipline, producing ten pages a day, after which he runs ten kilometres (he began long-distance running in 1982 and has participated in numerous marathons and races), works on translations, and then reads, listens to records and cooks. His passions colour his non-fiction output, from What I Talk About When I Talk About Running to Absolutely On Music, and they also seep into his novels and short stories, providing quotidian moments in his otherwise freewheeling flights of imaginative inquiry. In works such as The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, 1Q84 and Men Without Women, his distinctive blend of the mysterious and the everyday, of melancholy and humour, continues to enchant readers, ensuring Murakami&#39;s place as one of the world&#39;s most acclaimed and well-loved writers.</p><h2>Expressing Land, Sea, and Sky in Watercolor</h2><p>Only slight signs of age to book, DJ has edgeware and damage at corners.

Drawing on numerous unpublished sources, he examines in detail the peculiar friendship between the Oxford mathematician Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) and Alice Liddell, the child for whom he invented the Alice stories, and analyzes how this relationship stirred Carroll&#x2019;s imagination and influenced the creation of Wonderland. It also explains why <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> (1865) and its sequel, <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i> (1871), took on an unstoppable cultural momentum in the Victorian era and why, a century and a half later, they continue to enthrall and delight readers of all ages.</p><p><i>The Story of Alice</i> reveals Carroll as both an innovator and a stodgy traditionalist, entrenched in habits and routines. He had a keen double interest in keeping things moving and keeping them just as they are. (In Looking-Glass Land, Alice must run faster and faster just to stay in one place.) Tracing the development of the Alice books from their inception in 1862 to Liddell&#x2019;s death in 1934, Douglas-Fairhurst also provides a keyhole through which to observe a larger, shifting cultural landscape: the birth of photography, changing definitions of childhood, murky questions about sex and sexuality, and the relationship between Carroll&#x2019;s books and other works of Victorian literature.</p><p>In the stormy transition from the Victorian to the modern era, Douglas-Fairhurst shows, Wonderland became a sheltered world apart, where the line between the actual and the possible was continually blurred.</p></p><p>Robert Douglas-Fairhurst is Professor of English Literature and a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford.Remarkable...[<b>Douglas-Fairhurst</b>] casts a wide net, brilliantly bringing together the stories of Carroll, Alice Liddell and the Alice phenomenon itself to provide the most nuanced and convincing picture yet of Wonderland&#x2019;s quirky, self-effacing creator...Thanks to <i>The Story of Alice</i>, we have not merely &#x201c;The Secret History of Wonderland&#x201d; that its subtitle promises, but also a secret history of our virtual age.

And it&#x2019;s brilliant in the way it mirrors Carroll&#x2019;s own protean nature, offering no overarching theme, except to establish that its subject was not a man to provide two possible meanings for all he did and said, not so long as he could stuff in three or more.

The wealthy young noble will follow his father&#x2014;newly made a lord by the King of Gernia&#x2014;into the cavalry, training in the military arts at the elite King's Cavella Academy in the capital city of Old Thares. Bright and well-educated, an excellent horseman with an advantageous engagement, Nevare's future appears golden.</p><p>But as his Academy instruction progresses, Nevare begins to realize that the road before him is far from straight. The old aristocracy looks down on him as the son of a "new noble" and, unprepared for the political and social maneuvering of the deeply competitive school and city, the young man finds himself entangled in a web of injustice, discrimination, and foul play. In addition, he is disquieted by his unconventional girl-cousin Epiny&#x2014;who challenges his heretofore unwavering world view&#x2014;and by the bizarre dreams that haunt his nights.</p><p>For twenty years the King's cavalry has pushed across the grasslands, subduing and settling its nomads and claiming the territory in Gernia's name. Now they have driven as far as the Barrier Mountains, home to the Speck people, a quiet, forest-dwelling folk who retain the last vestiges of magic in a world that is rapidly becoming modernized. From childhood Nevare has been taught that the Specks are a primitive people to be pitied for their backward ways&#x2014;and feared for their indigenous diseases, including the deadly Speck plague, which has ravaged the frontier towns and military outposts.</p><p>The Dark Evening brings the carnival to Old Thares, and with it an unknown magic, and the first Specks Nevare has ever seen . . .</p></p><p><p>Robin Hobb was born in California but grew up in Alaska.

Under the name Megan Lindholm she is the author of <em>The Wizard of the Pigeons</em>, <em>Windsingers</em>, and <em>Cloven Hooves</em>. <em>The Inheritance</em>, a collection of stories, was published under both names. Her short fiction has won the Asimov's Readers' Award and she has been a finalist for both the Nebula and Hugo awards.</p>A big, splendid novel opens the Soldier Son trilogy. Nevare Burville has spent some time as a cavalry officer on the kingdom of Gernia's frontier, engaged in expanding it against the wild nomads of the plains. He has been successful as a soldier, he is happily engaged, and he is the scion of one of the new noble families. Unfortunately, now he has to complete his military education at the King's Cavalry Academy, which is dominated by scions of the old nobility, who have no use for upstarts like Nevare. Also, it appears that Nevare has been too long within range of the powerful magic of the shamans of the western tribes, and their influence has converted him into a sort of sorcerous Typhoid Mary--and he may not be the only one. The consequences for Nevare personally are grim, and for Gernia potentially grimmer, if a way to fight the "barbarian" magic isn't extracted from civilized knowledge. Oh yes, Hobb's characterization, especially anent the ethical dilemmas, and world building are again superb. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Whether it's poaching in plastic or using vegetable waters instead of fat to enrich flavor, or new tricks with the inexpensive Japanese mandoline, professionals expand our horizons. And among his colleagues, Michel Richard is <i>the</i> chef's chef, the one others look to for inspiration. "Why didn't I think of that?" asks Thomas Keller, in his foreword to <i>Happy in the Kitchen</i>, about Richard's innovative technique. Michel Richard leads the way and always has&#x2014;at his L.A. restaurants, Citrus and Citronelle, and now in Washington, D.C., at Michel Richard Citronelle and his newly opened Central. He never ceases to explore and his food never fails to satisfy. <br><br><i>Happy in the Kitchen</i> is teeming with "Richard-esque" discoveries, whether it's an amazingly simple technique for dicing vegetables, a delicious [low-carb] carbonara made with onions rather than pasta, or a schnitzel made of pureed squid. He's playful&#x2014;always&#x2014;but also a perfectionist and an iconoclast. What can you say about a chef who makes risotto with potatoes, prefers frozen Brussels sprouts, and whips up spectacular chocolate pudding and b�chamel in the microwave? A chef who doesn't shock blanched vegetables in ice water, but uses his freezer as though it were a fifth burner, and turns raspberries and almonds into "salami"? <br><br> Enamored of crispness, this master chef, who calls himself Captain Crunch, makes a potato gratin that is all crust and fries carrots until crisp. Always seeking to surprise, he stuffs onion shells and serves them as pasta, and he scrambles scallops and serves them as if they were eggs. But the surprise is not just in the form the ingredients take in each dish, but in the taste.<br><br> Richard offers recipes for the foods we love, but always looks for the twist that makes good things great&#x2014;whether it's Lamburgers, Lobster Burgers, or Tuna Burgers, Turkey "Steak" au Poivre, or the chocolate reverie Michel calls Le Kit Cat. And with recipe titles such as Shrimp "Einstein," Jolly Green Brussels Sprouts, Chicken Faux Gras, Figgy Piggy, Chocolate Popcorn, and Happy Kid Pudding, <i>Happy in the Kitchen</i> lets you know you're in for good tastes and good times. <br><br> Every delicious moment is captured in glorious images of finished dishes, as well as exceptional step-by-step photographs that make easy work of slicing, dicing, shaping, and other essential hand skills. <i>Happy in the Kitchen</i> is a book that will make you laugh and learn, and it will delight you every step of the way.</p><p>"In cooking as in love, you have to try new things to keep it interesting." So says chef Michel Richard in his cookbook <i>Happy in the Kitchen</i>, a collection of 150-plus recipes that more than make his point. Whether reinventing traditional recipes, often whimsically, as he does with dishes like Tomato Tartare, Cuttlefish Schnitzel, and Turkey "Steak" au Poivre, or presenting otherwise novel treats like Tuna Medallions with Passion Fruit Salsa; Chicken with Preserved Lemon and Honeydew Melon; and Lamb-Loin with Basil Crust and Fennel, Richard delights readers with creativity that can thrill. Vegetable dishes, including his spuds-for-rice Potato Risotto and Lo-Carb Carbonara, in which sliced onions sub for pasta, are particularly ingenious. Equally novel--and tempting--are sweets like Upside-Down Chocolate Orange Sponge Cake, Lemon-Lime Madeleine Muffins, and Raspberry Meringues with Raspberry Tuiles. <p> To pull off his particular sleight-of-hand, Richard has devised novel techniques--like using plastic film to shape and poach food, and gelatin to bind fatlessly--that all cooks should know about. Whether readers will tackle the often-exacting recipes will depend on their willingness to engage in kitchen workouts that also regularly require special equipment like a Japanese mandoline and electric meat slicer. Though there are a number of simpler, homier recipes like Tomato Soup with Fresh Mozzarella and Thyme-Glazed Baby Back Ribs--and the formulas themselves couldn't be more lucid--this handsome book will probably be best appreciated as an artful record of a great and wonderfully playful cooking intelligence. Replete with stunning photos, used generously to illustrate techniques, it's hard to imagine any serious cook who wouldn't want to join Richard, dig in, and learn. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Michel Richard is a man giddy with invention. Enamored of crispness, this master chef, who calls himself Captain Crunch, makes a potato gratin that is all crust. He makes his grits with tomato water rather than stock (lighter and fresher). He br�l�es chocolate mousse, makes risotto from potatoes, and &#x201c;salami&#x201d; out of raspberries and almonds. He&#x2019;s always looking for the twist that makes good things great&#x2014;whether it&#x2019;s his lamburgers, lobster burgers, tuna burgers, turkey &#x201c;steak&#x201d; au poivre, or the chocolate reverie Michel calls Le Kit Cat.<br><br> Step-by-step photos demonstrate Richard&#x2019;s innovative technique that makes easy work of dicing, shaping, ruffling, and a plethora of other indispensable hand skills. With recipe titles such as Shrimp &#x201c;Einstein,&#x201d; Jackson Pollock Soup, Chicken Faux Gras, Figgy Piggy, and Happy Kid Pudding (made in the microwave), <i>Happy in the Kitchen&#x2019;s</i> promise is good tastes and good times.</p><h2>Earth from Above</h2><p>Both low- and high-level aerial photographs document places around the world and form the starting point for discussions of ecology, sustainable development, and the current state of the world.</p><p>Ecology, a science scarcely a century old, aims to give its practitioners an approach to understanding how whole natural systems--for example, watersheds, deserts, and estuaries--work. Few books translate this aim as well as <i>Earth from Above</i>, a stunning collection of photographs that affords its viewers a window into the world's workings. It is something of a commonplace, for instance, that the large-scale logging now being visited on the world's rainforests is causing untold damage to tropical ecosystems. In French photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand's hands, this problem is translated from arid fact to alarming image, giving immediate meaning to the statistics that underlie today's environmental headlines; his photographs of the ruins of rural Madagascar, where forests are being cleared at a rate of 1,500 square kilometers (580 square miles) annually, are a sad case in point.<p> Arthus-Bertrand, working with the support of UNESCO, has wandered the globe to gather this collection of more than 200 photographs, presented in a folio format. The images are uniformly striking, whether of stalagmite-like fans of algae spreading into the Mediterranean Sea, farmers working their fields in northern India, or destroyed Iraqi tanks littering the deserts of Kuwait. The accompanying text, captions, and short essays by some of France's leading scientists and social critics lend specific depth to the images, which will cheer few readers--but that will shock, and educate, and, with luck, inspire closer attention to the world around us. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Reviews <p></p><p>"A terrific book to look at and think about."-New York Times Book Review </p><p>"Life on Earth will never look quite the same again once you've seen Earth From Above." -Hemispheres </p><p>"An eye-popping book."-Los Angeles Times</p></p><h2>Hush Now, Don&#39;t You Cry (Molly Murphy Mysteries)</h2><p><p>In the latest in Rhys Bowen's award-winning historical series, Molly Murphy is supposed to give up sleuthing now that she's married, but the murder of an alderman puts her on the trail of a killer. </p><p>Molly Murphy, now Molly Sullivan, and her husband Daniel, a captain in the New York Police department, have been invited to spend their honeymoon on the Newport, RI, estate of Alderman Brian Hannan in the spring of 1904. Molly doesn't entirely trust the offer. Hannan--an ambitious man--has his eye on a senate seat and intentions of taking Tammany Hall to get it. When Hannan is found dead at the base of the cliffs that overlook the Atlantic, Molly's suspicions are quickly justified, and as much as she wants to keep her promise to Daniel that she won't do any more sleuthing now, there isn't much she can do once the chase is on.

Rain swept in great squalls off the ocean, snatching the words from my mouth. It was not a night to be standing on a clifftop in complete darkness. Our umbrella had given up the unequal struggle with the storm on the way from the station and now lay in a rubbish bin, its ribs sticking out like a large dead spider. Daniel had deposited it there despite my protests, stating that it was past all hope of repair.<br>It was a long walk from the station and not one that should have been attempted on a stormy night. But we had little choice. The directions we had been given were for a delightful afternoon stroll along a cliff path, with blue ocean below us. We had not anticipated that Daniel would be delayed with a last minute problem at headquarters and that what the locals called a nor&#x2019;easter would arrive at the same time as ourselves.<br>After changing trains in Providence, then again to a branch line in Kingston, we finally pulled into Newport station, at almost ten o&#x2019;clock. There was not a hansom cab or any kind of conveyance to be found. The town appeared to be battened down in anticipation of the coming storm. We&#x2019;d set off bravely enough under Daniel&#x2019;s big umbrella but once out of the town center, heading toward the clifftop footpath the full force of the wind had turned the umbrella inside out and ripped it to shreds in minutes.<br>&#x201c;Damn and blast it,&#x201d; Daniel had muttered, no longer apologizing if he swore in my presence now that I was married to him. &#x201c;We should have waited for the morning. I should not have listened to you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What, and missed a whole day of our honeymoon?&#x201d; I demanded as I struggled to take off my new hat. It was a jaunty little concoction piled high with ribbons and lace and I certainly didn&#x2019;t want to lose it over the cliff. I stuffed it into my carpetbag, probably not doing it much good in the process but at least preventing it from sailing off into the ocean. &#x201c;Cheer up. I&#x2019;m sure it can&#x2019;t be far. Newport is only a small seaside town, isn&#x2019;t it? Just a few cottages, I was told.&#x201d;<br>Daniel had to chuckle at this and put an arm around my shoulders. &#x201c;You wait until daylight and then you&#x2019;ll see the extent of the cottages.&#x201d;<br>In my mind&#x2019;s eye I pictured a long road like the one leading into Westport in Ireland, with simple whitewashed cottages stretching along the side of the road facing the sea. It would be nice to be spending my honeymoon in a place that reminded me of home, I had thought when Daniel told me of this opportunity.<br>The walk turned from an annoyance into a frightening experience. We tried to follow a dark little street called Cliff Avenue, but it ended in a pair of high, locked gates, forcing us back to our original route along the cliff&#x2014;not what we would have chosen on a dark night. No lights shone out through the storm and we could hear the pounding waves crashing onto rocks below us. That cliff path seemed to go on forever and even I began to doubt the sense of wanting to reach our cottage tonight. Luckily the wind was blowing in from the ocean or I should have worried about being swept over that unseen cliff edge to our deaths.<br>&#x201c;Are you sure this is the right way?&#x201d; I shouted, grabbing on to Daniel&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Are there no roads in this place? Is this cottage not on a proper street?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Obviously,&#x201d; Daniel said tersely. &#x201c;But it never occurred to me to ask for foul weather directions. I assumed there would be a cab if we needed one.&#x201d;<br>I peered into the blackness. &#x201c;There are no lights. We can&#x2019;t be near any cottages. Surely the whole population of Newport doesn&#x2019;t go to bed by nine o&#x2019;clock?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s October. None of the cottages are likely to be inhabited at this time of year,&#x201d; Daniel shouted back. &#x201c;They are only used in the summer.&#x201d;<br>The thought of being the only people in a remote seaside village had seemed desirable when Daniel had presented it to me, our original honeymoon plans having fallen through when Daniel was summoned back to work two days after our wedding. I had borne this with remarkable patience for once, understanding that this was to be the lot of a policeman&#x2019;s wife. I think Daniel had been impressed by my stoicism and had promised me that we would escape from the city as soon as his work permitted. So when the offer of a seaside cottage had come up, he&#x2019;d jumped at it. Of course October was a little late in the year for beaches and bathing, but we had other activities in mind anyway. And this part of the country often experienced what they called an Indian summer, with glorious sunny days and glowing fall colors. Just not this year, it appeared.<br>&#x201c;Nearly there, I think.&#x201d; Daniel propelled me forward, his arm still around my waist. &#x201c;Then a bath and a hot drink will soon bring us to rights. Ah, this way. I believe we follow this wall and it will lead us to the gate.&#x201d;<br>As Daniel took my hand and guided me away from the cliff path, there was an ominous rumble of thunder overhead. A few moments later a flash of lightning lit up towering wrought-iron gates. Daniel felt for a latch but the gates refused to open.<br>&#x201c;Blast and damnation!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;These infernal gates must open somehow.&#x201d; He shook them in frustration but they refused to budge.<br>&#x201c;They knew we were expected today, didn&#x2019;t they?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see any lights.&#x201d; I was soaked to the skin, my teeth chattering now, my hair plastered to my face, and my clothes clinging to me. All I wanted was to get indoors to a fire and a cup of tea.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand it. I know the family is not usually here at this time of year, but there has to be a caretaker on the property,&#x201d; Daniel snapped out the words. &#x201c;But we have no way of alerting anyone, unless we walk back into town and see if we can reach the place by telephone.&#x201d;<br>This suggestion didn&#x2019;t seem too appealing. &#x201c;Everything seemed to be closed for the night in town. Besides we can&#x2019;t walk all the way back,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re already soaked to the skin. I don&#x2019;t suppose it&#x2019;s any good shouting.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No one would hear us with this infernal racket going on.&#x201d;<br>Thunder growled again and once again the scene was illuminated with a lighting flash. It revealed a long driveway behind those gates and in the distance the great black shape of what seemed to be an enormous castle. I stared in amazement.<br>&#x201c;I thought you said it was a cottage.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I wanted to surprise you,&#x201d; Daniel replied in an annoyed voice. &#x201c;The wealthy who own summer homes in Newport call them cottages but they are actually mansions. This one is called Connemara.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Holy mother of God,&#x201d; I muttered. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not getting a whole mansion to ourselves are we?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, we&#x2019;ve been offered the guest cottage on the property. If only we can find a way in.&#x201d; He rattled the gates again angrily.<br>I had been experiencing a growing sense of anxiety. It wasn&#x2019;t just the howl of the storm and the flashes of lightning. God knows I&#x2019;d seen enough storms on the West Coast of Ireland. It was something more. &#x201c;Daniel, don&#x2019;t let&#x2019;s stay here,&#x201d; I blurted out suddenly. &#x201c;Perhaps we should go back into town after all. There is bound to be a hotel or inn of some sort where we can spend the night. The house clearly doesn&#x2019;t want us.&#x201d;<br>Daniel gave me a quizzical smile. &#x201c;The house doesn&#x2019;t want us?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting this overwhelming feeling that we shouldn&#x2019;t be here, that we&#x2019;re not wanted.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You and your sixth sense,&#x201d; Daniel said. He was still prowling, staring up at the gates and the high stone wall. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll feel differently when we&#x2019;re safely inside. I am determined to find a way in, even if I have to scale that wall.&#x201d;<br>A great clap of thunder right overhead drowned out his last words and simultaneously the world was bathed in electric blue light. I was staring up at the house and I saw a face quite clearly framed in an upstairs window. It was a child&#x2019;s face and it was laughing with maniacal glee.<br>I let go of the bars of the gate as if burned. &#x201c;Come away!&#x201d; I shouted. &#x201c;We shouldn&#x2019;t be here.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2012 by Rhys Bowen<br></p><h2>Alfie and the Birthday Surprise</h2><p>Hoping that a surprise birthday party will help to cheer up neighbor and store owner Mr. MacNally, Alfie plans an additional, extra-special surprise and fears he cannot keep his plans a secret.</p><p>The loss of a family pet is skillfully handled within the secure world of Alfie and Annie Rose. <br>Mr. McNally, the neighbour of Alfie and Annie Rose, is very sad. His old cat Smokey has died. As it is nearly his birthday, his family decides to hold a surprise party and buy a particularly special present to cheer him up. It is left to Alfie to look after the present until the big day... New readers and old fans of Alfie alike will cozy up to the warm and sympathetic text, and illustrations bustling with detail and charm.Shirley Hughes was trained at Liverpool Art School and at the Ruskin School of Art, Oxford. She illustrated many books by other authors before she started to write her own picture books. Her own family, two sons and a daughter, were very young then and she learned the craft of storytelling mostly by reading to them. Her books have won many awards and are published in Europe, China, Japan, and the Far East, as well as Australia, Canada, the U. K., and the U. S. A. She travels widely, talking to and drawing for children in schools and libraries as well as at adult conventions. <p>Shirley is married to an architect, now retired, and they have lived in the same family house, overlooking a London square garden, for more than forty years. They have, to date, six grandchildren who keep them on their toes.In Her Own Words...</p><p>"I grew up in a nice, quiet, well-behaved suburb of Liverpool. But our uneventful lives were rudely interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. Wewent to school carrrying gas masks, did air-raid shelter drills, saved Up mountains of scrap metal, and attempted to knit Mufflers for the troops. (Mine were very long; I never quite got the hang of casting off.)I slept under the stairs (hiring the winter of the big blitz, when we saw the sky over Liverpool lit by searchlights, tracer bullets, and Fires from the burning docks.</p><p>"All this may sound very exciting, But the problem with wartime is that when it's not frightening, it's deadly dull. You can't go on holiday, the grown-ups are too harassed and exhausted to pay much attention to amusements, and every nice kind of food is scarce. I recall, on a rare trip to the seaside (the beach was out of bounds, full of barbed wire and concrete gun emplacements), gazing at a longempty slot machine which had held chocolate bars and now seemed like a rusting icon from another world.</p><p>"Nevertheless, we managed to have a good time. We drew a lot, read and wrote stories, and got up magazines. (Mine was called, rather unoriginally, 'Girl's Own.) We acted plays, dressed in homemade costumes, to any audience we could press into service, cats included. Later, we became hopelessly stageand movie-struck. I think that by accident I had an ideal childhood for an illustrator. In a pre-televisual age, our Sunday afternoon outings, if we were lucky, were to Liverpool Art Gallery, which was cram-full of Victorian an narrative paintings with titles like 'The Hopeless Dawn,' 'Too Late!,' and 'When Did You Last See Your Father?' Tremendous stuff, and it fueled my lifelong conviction that stories and pictures belong together. I think most children probably feel the same.</p><p>"With me, drawing and painting stuck. I was never much good at anything else, so I went on doing them. Writing was a secret thing, kept well under wraps. When I emerged from art school, I wrote to a distinguished typographer saying I wanted to illustrate children's books. He wrote back saying that this was impossible 'except as an adjunct to teaching or matrimony.' All the same, I was determined to do it.</p><p>"When I think of an idea for a story, it always starts with a very strong image in my head, usually of a child doing something. With picture books, the words are unthinkable without the images-the two develop together, like a film. Alfie first made his appearance running up the street ahead of his mum, who came trundling behind with the shopping and his baby sister, Annie Rose, in the buggy. I knew from the first moment I reached for a pencil to get down a rough drawing of him that he was positively pink in the face with determination to get into the action. A lot has happened to him-and to mesince. He is a very ordinary little boy, a kind of fouryear-old Everyman just beginning to come to grips with the complexities of life. Now, rather to my amazement, well over two million Alfie books have been sold worldwide. But I still relate back to that rapid sketch done in a state of high excitement, which is where it all began."</p></p><h2>Bare Bones: I&#39;m Not Lonely If You&#39;re Reading This Book</h2><p><p><strong>#1 <em>New York Times</em> Bestseller</strong> </p><p>A touching, funny, heart-wrenching, and triumphant memoir from one of the biggest names in radio, the host of <em>The Bobby Bones Show</em>, one of the most listened-to drive time morning radio shows in the nation.</p><p>Growing up poor in Mountain Pine, Arkansas, with a young, addicted mom, Bobby Estell fell in love with country music.

Grind. Repeat.&#x201d; mantra that makes him one of the busiest guys in the business. Raised by an alcoholic single mother who often resorted to shoplifting to put food on the table and by a grandmother who taught him to shop garage sales, play poker, and love music, Bobby spent his childhood in the hills and trailer parks of Mountain Pine, Arkansas; his is as simple a story as it gets. But Bobby wasn&#x2019;t going to settle, and when he got his first radio as a birthday present, he focused his mind on getting on the air and beyond. From Arkansas to Austin and eventually to Nashville, Bobby Bones has created the show he always dreamed about, one where he gets to do the thing he loves while hanging out with his friends.</p><p>Full of stories from his childhood, his brushes with the best and the beautiful of music&#x2014;hint: not all of them like him (oh well)&#x2014;the hijinks and moments of real danger that have been a part of his journey, and the self-deprecating humor that only Bobby Bones could bring, <em>Bare Bones</em> is a heartfelt, funny, and honest tale of someone who has truly lived the American dream.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame as the youngest honoree ever, Bobby Bones has been dubbed &#x201c;the most powerful man in country music&#x201d; by <em>Forbes.</em> His nationally syndicated radio show, <em>The Bobby Bones Show,</em> reaches millions of listeners weekly on more than one hundred stations and recently garnered its third Academy of Country Music Award for National On-Air Personality of the Year, also earning a 2017 Country Music Association Award for National Broadcast Personality of the Year.

Additionally, he appeared on ABC&#x2019;s <em>American Idol</em> as the mentor to the Top 24 contestants. His memoir, <em>Bare Bones, </em>landed at #1 on the <em>New York Times, USA Today,</em> and <em>Wall Street Journal</em> bestseller lists.&nbsp; </p></p><h2>A Light in the Window (The Mitford Years, Book 2)</h2><p>Available for the first time in an attractive hardcover edition, the second installment in the author&#39;s best-selling Mitford Years series focuses on the hilarious romantic dilemmas faced by Father Tim, the village parson of Mitford.</p><p><i>A Light in the Window</i> is the second installment in this enormously popular series about a small-town rector, Father Tim, and the heartwarming cast of characters surrounding him. This time Father Tim, a lifelong bachelor, finds his heart distracted by his free-spirited neighbor Cynthia, but his stomach and the rectory cash box are distracted by Edith, a wealthy widow who is wooing the rector with love potion casseroles. At every turn, including when a brooding Irish cousin decides to move in, Father Tim must decide whether he will practice what he preaches. <p> Fans of the series say they long to buy real estate in Mitford, just so they can live next door to these funny and endearing characters and feel the embrace of such a loving community. But what author Jan Karon probably knows, and many readers are starting to figure out, is that the integrity and solid Christian values that these characters possess can be found in just about every neighborhood, and with inspiration like this book, anyone can build their own Mitford community. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><p><b>Jan Karon</b>, born Janice Meredith Wilson in the foothills of North Carolina, was named after the title of a popular novel, Janice Meredith.</p> <p>Jan wrote her first novel at the age of ten. "The manuscript was written on Blue Horse notebook paper, and was, for good reason, kept hidden from my sister. When she found it, she discovered the one curse word I had, with pounding heart, included in someone's speech. For Pete's sake, hadn't Rhett Butler used that very same word and gotten away with it? After my grandmother's exceedingly focused reproof, I've written books without cussin' ever since."</p> <p>Several years ago, Karon left a successful career in advertising to move to the mountain village of Blowing Rock, North Carolina, and write books. "I stepped out on faith to follow my lifelong dream of being an author," she says. "I made real sacrifices and took big risks. But living, it seems to me, is largely about risk."</p> <p>Enthusiastic booksellers across the country have introduced readers of all ages to Karon's heartwarming books. <i>At Home in Mitford</i>, Karon's first book in the Mitford series, was nominated for an ABBY by the American Booksellers Association in 1996 and again in 1997. Bookstore owner, Shirley Sprinkle, says, "The Mitford Books have been our all-time fiction bestsellers since we went in business twenty-five years ago. We've sold 10,000 of Jan's books and don't see any end to the Mitford phenomenon."</p></p><h2>The Reader (Movie Tie-in Edition) (Vintage International)</h2><p>Hailed for its coiled eroticism and the moral claims it makes upon the reader, this mesmerizing novel is a story of love and secrets, horror and compassion, unfolding against the haunted landscape of postwar Germany.When he falls ill on his way home from school, fifteen-year-old Michael Berg is rescued by Hanna, a woman twice his age. In time she becomes his lover&#x2014;then she inexplicably disappears. When Michael next sees her, he is a young law student, and she is on trial for a hideous crime. As he watches her refuse to defend her innocence, Michael gradually realizes that Hanna may be guarding a secret she considers more shameful than murder.</p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, February 1999:</b> Originally published in Switzerland, and gracefully translated into English by Carol Brown Janeway, <i>The Reader</i> is a brief tale about sex, love, reading, and shame in postwar Germany. Michael Berg is 15 when he begins a long, obsessive affair with Hanna, an enigmatic older woman. He never learns very much about her, and when she disappears one day, he expects never to see her again. But, to his horror, he does. Hanna is a defendant in a trial related to Germany's Nazi past, and it soon becomes clear that she is guilty of an unspeakable crime. As Michael follows the trial, he struggles with an overwhelming question: What should his generation do with its knowledge of the Holocaust? "We should not believe we can comprehend the incomprehensible, we may not compare the incomparable.... Should we only fall silent in revulsion, shame, and guilt? To what purpose?"<p> <i>The Reader</i>, which won the <i>Boston Book Review</i>'s Fisk Fiction Prize, wrestles with many more demons in its few, remarkably lucid pages. What does it mean to love those people--parents, grandparents, even lovers--who committed the worst atrocities the world has ever known? And is any atonement possible through literature? Schlink's prose is clean and pared down, stripped of unnecessary imagery, dialogue, and excess in any form. What remains is an austerely beautiful narrative of the attempt to breach the gap between Germany's pre- and postwar generations, between the guilty and the innocent, and between words and silence. <i>--R. Ellis</i></p>"A formally beautiful, disturbing and finally morally devastating novel." --Los Angeles Times<br><br>"Moving, suggestive and ultimately hopeful. . . .

He stared down at the boy in the red zip-up jacket and shook his shaved head. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t bring that thing in here.&#x201d;<br> <br>The fifty or so teenagers in line outside the Pandemonium Club leaned forward to eavesdrop. It was a long wait to get into the all-ages club, especially on a Sunday, and not much generally happened in line. The bouncers were fierce and would come down instantly on anyone who looked like they were going to start trouble. Fifteen-year-old Clary Fray, standing in line with her best friend, Simon, leaned forward along with everyone else, hoping for some excitement.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aw, come on.&#x201d; The kid hoisted the thing up over his head. It looked like a wooden beam, pointed at one end. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s part of my costume.&#x201d;<br> <br>The bouncer raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Which is what?&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy grinned. He was normal-enough-looking, Clary thought, for Pandemonium. He had electric blue dyed hair that stuck up around his head like the tentacles of a startled octopus, but no elaborate facial tattoos or big metal bars through his ears or lips. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a vampire hunter.&#x201d; He pushed down on the wooden thing. It bent as easily as a blade of grass bending sideways. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fake. Foam rubber. See?&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy&#x2019;s wide eyes were way too bright a green, Clary noticed: the color of antifreeze, spring grass. Colored contact lenses, probably. The bouncer shrugged, abruptly bored. &#x201c;Whatever. Go on in.&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy slid past him, quick as an eel. Clary liked the lilt to his shoulders, the way he tossed his hair as he went. There was a word for him that her mother would have used&#x2014;insouciant.<br> <br>&#x201c;You thought he was cute,&#x201d; said Simon, sounding resigned. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary dug her elbow into his ribs, but didn&#x2019;t answer.<br> <br><br> <br>Inside, the club was full of dry-ice smoke. Colored lights played over the dance floor, turning it into a multicolored fairyland of blues and acid greens, hot pinks and golds.<br> <br>The boy in the red jacket stroked the long razor-sharp blade in his hands, an idle smile playing over his lips. It had been so easy&#x2014;a little bit of a glamour on the blade, to make it look harmless. Another glamour on his eyes, and the moment the bouncer had looked straight at him, he was in. Of course, he could probably have gotten by without all that trouble, but it was part of the fun&#x2014;fooling the mundies, doing it all out in the open right in front of them, getting off on the blank looks on their sheeplike faces.<br> <br>Not that the humans didn&#x2019;t have their uses. The boy&#x2019;s green eyes scanned the dance floor, where slender limbs clad in scraps of silk and black leather appeared and disappeared inside the revolving columns of smoke as the mundies danced. Girls tossed their long hair, boys swung their leather-clad hips, and bare skin glittered with sweat. Vitality just poured off them, waves of energy that filled him with a drunken dizziness. His lip curled. They didn&#x2019;t know how lucky they were. They didn&#x2019;t know what it was like to eke out life in a dead world, where the sun hung limp in the sky like a burned cinder. Their lives burned as brightly as candle flames&#x2014;and were as easy to snuff out.<br> <br>His hand tightened on the blade he carried, and he had begun to step out onto the dance floor when a girl broke away from the mass of dancers and began walking toward him. He stared at her. She was beautiful, for a human&#x2014;long hair nearly the precise color of black ink, charcoaled eyes. Floor-length white gown, the kind women used to wear when this world was younger. Lace sleeves belled out around her slim arms. Around her neck was a thick silver chain, on which hung a dark red pendant the size of a baby&#x2019;s fist. He only had to narrow his eyes to know that it was real&#x2014;real and precious. His mouth started to water as she neared him. Vital energy pulsed from her like blood from an open wound. She smiled, passing him, beckoning with her eyes. He turned to follow her, tasting the phantom sizzle of her death on his lips.<br> <br>It was always easy. He could already feel the power of her evaporating life coursing through his veins like fire. Humans were so stupid. They had something so precious, and they barely safeguarded it at all. They threw away their lives for money, for packets of powder, for a stranger&#x2019;s charming smile. The girl was a pale ghost retreating through the colored smoke. She reached the wall and turned, bunching her skirt up in her hands, lifting it as she grinned at him. Under the skirt, she was wearing thigh-high boots.<br> <br>He sauntered up to her, his skin prickling with her nearness. Up close she wasn&#x2019;t so perfect: He could see the mascara smudged under her eyes, the sweat sticking her hair to her neck. He could smell her mortality, the sweet rot of corruption. Got you, he thought.<br> <br>A cool smile curled her lips. She moved to the side, and he could see that she was leaning against a closed door. NO ADMITTANCE&#x2014;STORAGE was scrawled across it in red paint. She reached behind her for the knob, turned it, slid inside. He caught a glimpse of stacked boxes, tangled wiring. A storage room. He glanced behind him&#x2014;no one was looking. So much the better if she wanted privacy.<br> <br>He slipped into the room after her, unaware that he was being followed.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Simon said, &#x201c;pretty good music, eh?&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary didn&#x2019;t reply. They were dancing, or what passed for it&#x2014;a lot of swaying back and forth with occasional lunges toward the floor as if one of them had dropped a contact lens&#x2014;in a space between a group of teenage boys in metallic corsets, and a young Asian couple who were making out passionately, their colored hair extensions tangled together like vines. A boy with a lip piercing and a teddy bear backpack was handing out free tablets of herbal ecstasy, his parachute pants flapping in the breeze from the wind machine. Clary wasn&#x2019;t paying much attention to their immediate surroundings&#x2014;her eyes were on the blue-haired boy who&#x2019;d talked his way into the club. He was prowling through the crowd as if he were looking for something. There was something about the way he moved that reminded her of something . . . <br> <br>&#x201c;I, for one,&#x201d; Simon went on, &#x201c;am enjoying myself immensely.&#x201d;<br> <br>This seemed unlikely. Simon, as always, stuck out at the club like a sore thumb, in jeans and an old T-shirt that said MADE IN BROOKLYN across the front. His freshly scrubbed hair was dark brown instead of green or pink, and his glasses perched crookedly on the end of his nose. He looked less as if he were contemplating the powers of darkness and more as if he were on his way to chess club.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mmm-hmm.&#x201d; Clary knew perfectly well that he came to Pandemonium with her only because she liked it, that he thought it was boring. She wasn&#x2019;t even sure why it was that she liked it&#x2014;the clothes, the music made it like a dream, someone else&#x2019;s life, not her boring real life at all. But she was always too shy to talk to anyone but Simon.<br> <br>The blue-haired boy was making his way off the dance floor. He looked a little lost, as if he hadn&#x2019;t found whom he was looking for. Clary wondered what would happen if she went up and introduced herself, offered to show him around. Maybe he&#x2019;d just stare at her. Or maybe he was shy too. Maybe he&#x2019;d be grateful and pleased, and try not to show it, the way boys did&#x2014;but she&#x2019;d know. Maybe&#x2014;<br> <br>The blue-haired boy straightened up suddenly, snapping to attention, like a hunting dog on point. Clary followed the line of his gaze, and saw the girl in the white dress.<br> <br>Oh, well, Clary thought, trying not to feel like a deflated party balloon. I guess that&#x2019;s that. The girl was gorgeous, the kind of girl Clary would have liked to draw&#x2014;tall and ribbon-slim, with a long spill of black hair. Even at this distance Clary could see the red pendant around her throat. It pulsed under the lights of the dance floor like a separate, disembodied heart.<br> <br>&#x201c;I feel,&#x201d; Simon went on, &#x201c;that this evening DJ Bat is doing a singularly exceptional job. Don&#x2019;t you agree?&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary rolled her eyes and didn&#x2019;t answer; Simon hated trance music. Her attention was on the girl in the white dress. Through the darkness, smoke, and artificial fog, her pale dress shone out like a beacon. No wonder the blue-haired boy was following her as if he were under a spell, too distracted to notice anything else around him&#x2014;even the two dark shapes hard on his heels, weaving after him through the crowd.<br> <br>Clary slowed her dancing and stared. She could just make out that the shapes were boys, tall and wearing black clothes. She couldn&#x2019;t have said how she knew that they were following the other boy, but she did. She could see it in the way they paced him, their careful watchfulness, the slinking grace of their movements. A small flower of apprehension began to open inside her chest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Meanwhile,&#x201d; Simon added, &#x201c;I wanted to tell you that lately I&#x2019;ve been cross-dressing. Also, I&#x2019;m sleeping with your mom. I thought you should know.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl had reached the wall, and was opening a door marked NO ADMITTANCE. She beckoned the blue-haired boy after her, and they slipped through the door. It wasn&#x2019;t anything Clary hadn&#x2019;t seen before, a couple sneaking off to the dark corners of the club to make out&#x2014;but that made it even weirder that they were being followed.<br> <br>She raised herself up on tiptoe, trying to see over the crowd. The two guys had stopped at the door and seemed to be conferring with each other. One of them was blond, the other dark-haired. The blond one reached into his jacket and drew out something long and sharp that flashed under the strobing lights. A knife. &#x201c;Simon!&#x201d; Clary shouted, and seized his arm.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Simon looked alarmed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not really sleeping with your mom, you know. I was just trying to get your attention. Not that your mom isn&#x2019;t a very attractive woman, for her age.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you see those guys?&#x201d; She pointed wildly, almost hitting a curvy black girl who was dancing nearby. The girl shot her an evil look. &#x201c;Sorry&#x2014;sorry!&#x201d; Clary turned back to Simon. &#x201c;Do you see those two guys over there? By that door?&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon squinted, then shrugged. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There are two of them. They were following the guy with the blue hair&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The one you thought was cute?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but that&#x2019;s not the point. The blond one pulled a knife.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; Simon stared harder, shaking his head. &#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t see anyone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly all business, Simon squared his shoulders. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get one of the security guards. You stay here.&#x201d; He strode away, pushing through the crowd.<br> <br>Clary turned just in time to see the blond boy slip through the NO ADMITTANCE door, his friend right on his heels. She looked around; Simon was still trying to shove his way across the dance floor, but he wasn&#x2019;t making much progress. Even if she yelled now, no one would hear her, and by the time Simon got back, something terrible might already have happened. Biting hard on her lower lip, Clary started to wriggle through the crowd.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br> <br>She turned and smiled. What faint light there was in the storage room spilled down through high barred windows smeared with dirt. Piles of electrical cables, along with broken bits of mirrored disco balls and discarded paint cans littered the floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Isabelle.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a nice name.&#x201d; He walked toward her, stepping carefully among the wires in case any of them were live. In the faint light she looked half-transparent, bleached of color, wrapped in white like an angel. It would be a pleasure to make her fall. . . . &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen you here before.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re asking me if I come here often?&#x201d; She giggled, covering her mouth with her hand. There was some sort of bracelet around her wrist, just under the cuff of her dress&#x2014;then, as he neared her, he saw that it wasn&#x2019;t a bracelet at all but a pattern inked into her skin, a matrix of swirling lines.<br> <br>He froze. &#x201c;You&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t finish. She moved with lightning swiftness, striking out at him with her open hand, a blow to his chest that would have sent him down gasping if he&#x2019;d been a human being. He staggered back, and now there was something in her hand, a coiling whip that glinted gold as she brought it down, curling around his ankles, jerking him off his feet. He hit the ground, writhing, the hated metal biting deep into his skin. She laughed, standing over him, and dizzily he thought that he should have known. No human girl would wear a dress like the one Isabelle wore. She&#x2019;d worn it to cover her skin&#x2014;all of her skin.<br> <br>Isabelle yanked hard on the whip, securing it. Her smile glittered like poisonous water. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s all yours, boys.&#x201d;<br> <br>A low laugh sounded behind him, and now there were hands on him, hauling him upright, throwing him against one of the concrete pillars. He could feel the damp stone under his back. His hands were pulled behind him, his wrists bound with wire. As he struggled, someone walked around the side of the pillar into his view: a boy, as young as Isabelle and just as pretty. His tawny eyes glittered like chips of amber. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; the boy said. &#x201c;Are there any more with you?&#x201d;<br> <br>The blue-haired boy could feel blood welling up under the too-tight metal, making his wrists slippery. &#x201c;Any other what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on now.&#x201d; The tawny-eyed boy held up his hands, and his dark sleeves slipped down, showing the runes inked all over his wrists, the backs of his hands, his palms. &#x201c;You know what I am.&#x201d;<br> <br>Far back inside his skull, the shackled boy&#x2019;s second set of teeth began to grind.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shadowhunter,&#x201d; he hissed.<br> <br>The other boy grinned all over his face. &#x201c;Got you,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br><br> <br>Clary pushed the door to the storage room open, and stepped inside. For a moment she thought it was deserted. The only windows were high up and barred; faint street noise came through them, the sound of honking cars and squealing brakes. The room smelled like old paint, and a heavy layer of dust covered the floor, marked by smeared shoe prints.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s no one in here, she realized, looking around in bewilderment. It was cold in the room, despite the August heat outside. Her back was icy with sweat. She took a step forward, tangling her feet in electrical wires. She bent down to free her sneaker from the cables&#x2014;and heard voices. A girl&#x2019;s laugh, a boy answering sharply. When she straightened up, she saw them.<br> <br>It was as if they had sprung into existence between one blink of her eyes and the next. There was the girl in her long white dress, her black hair hanging down her back like damp seaweed. The two boys were with her&#x2014;the tall one with black hair like hers, and the smaller, fair one, whose hair gleamed like brass in the dim light coming through the windows high above. The fair boy was standing with his hands in his pockets, facing the punk kid, who was tied to a pillar with what looked like piano wire, his hands stretched behind him, his legs bound at the ankles. His face was pulled tight with pain and fear.<br> <br>Heart hammering in her chest, Clary ducked behind the nearest concrete pillar and peered around it. She watched as the fair-haired boy paced back and forth, his arms now crossed over his chest. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You still haven&#x2019;t told me if there are any other of your kind with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Your kind? Clary wondered what he was talkin...</p><h2>The Infernal Devices: Clockwork Princess (The Infernal Devices, 3)</h2><p>The threat of Mortmain&#39;s Infernal Devices looms as the Shadowhunters race to work out a way to counteract the mechanical monsters.

Stephanie needs cash&#x2015;fast&#x2015;but times are tough, and soon she's forced to turn to the last resort of the truly desperate: family...</p><p><b>ONE FALSE MOVE</b><br>Stephanie lands a gig at her sleazy cousin Vinnie's bail bonding company. She's got no experience. But that doesn't matter. Neither does the fact that the bail jumper in question is local vice cop Joe Morelli. From the time he first looked up her dress to the time he first got into her pants, to the time Steph hit him with her father's Buick, M-o-r-e-l-l-i has spelled t-r-o-u-b-l-e. And now the hot guy is in hot water&#x2015;wanted for murder...</p><p><b><i>ONE FOR THE MONEY</i></b><br>Abject poverty is a great motivator for learning new skills, but being trained in the school of hard knocks by people like psycho prizefighter Benito Ramirez isn't. Still, if Stephanie can nab Morelli in a week, she'll make a cool ten grand. All she has to do is become an expert bounty hunter overnight&#x2015;and keep herself from getting killed before she gets her man...</p></p><p>Stephanie Plum is so smart, so honest, and so funny that her narrative charm could drive a documentary on termites. But this tough gal from New Jersey, an unemployed discount lingerie buyer, has a much more interesting story to tell: She has to say that her Miata has been repossessed and that she's so poor at the moment that she just drank her last bottle of beer for breakfast. She has to say that her only chance out of her present rut is her repugnant cousin Vinnie and his bail-bond business. She has to say that she blackmailed Vinnie into giving her a bail-bond recovery job worth $10,000 (for a murder suspect), even though she doesn't own a gun and has never apprehended a person in her life. And she has to say that the guy she has to get, Joe Morelli, is the same creep who charmed away her teenage virginity behind the pastry case in the Trenton bakery where she worked after school.<p> If that hard-luck story doesn't sound compelling enough, Stephanie's several unsuccessful attempts at pulling in Joe make a downright hilarious and suspenseful tale of murder and deceit. Along the way, several more outlandish (but unrelentingly real) characters join the story, including Benito Ramirez, a champion boxer who seems to be following Stephanie Plum wherever she goes.</p><p> Janet Evanovich shares an authentic feel for the streets of Trenton in her debut mystery (she developed her talents in a string of romance novels before creating Ms. Plum), and her tough, frank, and funny first-person narrator offers a winning mix of vulgarity and sensitivity. Evanovich is certainly among the best of the new voices to emerge in the mystery field of the 1990s. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><p><b>Janet Evanovich</b> is the author of the Stephanie Plum books, including <i>Two for the Do</i>ugh and <i>Sizzling Sixteen</i>, and the Diesel &amp; Tucker series, including <i>Wicked Appetite</i>. Janet studied painting at Douglass College, but that art form never quite fit, and she soon moved on to writing stories. She didn't have instant success: she collected a big box of rejection letters. As she puts it, "When the box was full I burned the whole damn thing, crammed myself into pantyhose and went to work for a temp agency." But after a few months of secretarial work, she managed to sell her first novel for $2,000. She immediately quit her job and started working full-time as a writer.

What could be better than to work on a book with Victoria; plus it was a good excuse to drive to Ojai and shoot at her studio in amongst the heavenly citrus groves.<br><br> Under the watchful eye of the Topa Topa Mountains in Ojai&#x2014;nestled in among the colorful floral citrus groves&#x2014;is Victoria&#x2019;s house. Pixies, Kishus, oranges, grapefruits, and all things citrus ripen in the groves all year round. In March, when the blossoms explode, the air is filled with an unforgettable heady, hypnotic perfume, which lingers long into the evening. If Victoria has been away on location for a few days, the house will trap and concentrate the citrus blossom scents. When she returns home and opens the door, she is hit by the magical perfume.<br><br> Victoria inherited oranges, lemons, grapefruit, and a mystery citrus from the previous owners, so there is an endless supply year round&#x2014;the envy of Midwest and East Coast friends and family. This made her realize just how lucky she was to be able to pop outside and pluck a fat juicy lemon off one of her trees to squeeze over a salad. Her canning skills come in handy when she needs to make marmalades with all the bounty. Orange blossoms churn up teenage memories of driving in her parents&#x2019; 1965 Mustang with the top down on a warm California evening, the air heavy with scent. In fact, oranges were center stage at her wedding: swags of orange leaves and fruit adorned the rustic gate to welcome guests, and the cake was decorated with perfect marzipan oranges, leaves, and blossoms. She even made <i>vin d&#x2019;orange </i>(see page 93) for her wedding, which was bottled the night before by friends and family. &nbsp;<br><br> I live in Los Angeles with a garden that can only sustain cactus, but I have six large pots, which I proudly call &#x201c;my grove,&#x201d; where lemons, kumquats, and makrut limes all nestle together under the hot California sun. They are pollinated by bees and brightly colored humming birds&#x2014;a wonderful bonus. When they bloom, the air is floral, even with only six pots. My love for citrus grew as soon I moved to Los Angeles; everywhere I looked there were trees laden with lemons, oranges, grapefruits, and limes. Californians are so used to this that they leave fallen fruit on the ground. How could this be? The cook in me would go around and gather all this forgotten fruit and make jams and marmalades. Then I started to expand my repertoire, leaning heavily on Spanish and North African influences, lacing dishes with preserved lemons and perfuming them with orange blossoms. I began to dry orange peel to go in Szechuan recipes, salts, and sugars. I love to mix and match the wonderful bright zest and tangy flavors with heady spices and freshly picked herbs, marrying it all to Californian produce.<br><br> When I was a child growing up in Scotland, one of the highlights of Christmas was finding a bright orange tangerine at the bottom of my stocking&#x2014;a magical treat in itself. The fruits had come from warm sunny climates far from the snowy dark winter of Scotland. I never dreamed that one day I would live in one of the most abundant citrus states and cook with such wonderful fruits.<br><br> One of my favorite things to do is visit local farms where I can pick my own fruit. Walking through the quiet groves with bees buzzing in the air and trees laden with juicy plump fruits makes me appreciate where the fruit has come from. You get to experience the real farm-to-table taste. I come home revitalized, my head exploding with ideas of what I am going to create with this wonderful plunder.<br><br> We&#x2019;ve brought our love for all things citrus in the following chapters through personal recipes that we love to cook. Talking to local growers and sellers at our farmers&#x2019; markets yields a goldmine of knowledge and tips and is a nice way to share recipes and ideas. We encourage everyone to look for the lesser known varieties of citrus and have fun discovering new flavors.<br><br> But most of all, be mindful when you eat your next orange. Take time to peel it with care, smell the fragrance, and think about the star-shaped blossoms that soaked up the sun and rain to create this citrus wonder. And then enjoy every last bite.<br> &#x2014;Valerie Aikman-Smith<br><br>------------------------------------------------<br><br><b>tropical granola with candied lime</b><br><br>Start the day with a bowl full of sunshine and tropical flavors.

Family and friends gather at Aya's house every evening to watch the country's first television ad campaign promoting the fortifying effects of Solibra, "the strong man's beer." It's a golden time, and the nation, too--an oasis of affluence and stability in West Africa--seems fueled by something wondrous. <br>Who's to know that the Ivorian miracle is nearing its end? In the sun-warmed streets of working-class Yopougon, aka Yop City, holidays are around the corner, the open-air bars and discos are starting to fill up, and trouble of a different kind is about to raise eyebrows. At night, an empty table in the market square under the stars is all the privacy young lovers can hope for, and what happens there is soon everybody's business.<br><i>Aya</i> tells the story of its nineteen-year-old heroine, the studious and clear-sighted Aya, her easygoing friends Adjoua and Bintou, and their meddling relatives and neighbors. It's a breezy and wryly funny account of the desire for joy and freedom, and of the simple pleasures and private troubles of everyday life in Yop City. An unpretentious and gently humorous story of an Africa we rarely see-spirited, hopeful, and resilient--<i>Aya</i> won the 2006 award for Best First Album at the Angoul�me International Comics Festival. Cl�ment Oubrerie's warm colors and energetic, playful lines connect expressively with Marguerite Abouet's vibrant writing.</p><p>Marguerite Abouet was born in Abidjan in 1971 and now lives outside Paris. Clement Oubrerie was born in Paris in 1966 and has illustrated more than forty children&#39;s books.*Starred Review* Intelligent, practical, and kind older teen Aya has best girl friends besotted by romance and sex. She also seems to know a plethora of guys who are either intoxicated with their own studliness or a bit dim. Set in late 1970s Ivory Coast, this accessible, engaging story features a relatively simple plotline--smart girl frustrated by less-forward-thinking friends and family--and delightfully thorough characterizations that resound with emotional universality as they manifest the particulars of a time and a place American readers otherwise rarely glimpse. In perfect keeping with the narrator's youthful perspective, the young people's parents are visually exaggerated to go with stunted personalities. The locale is evoked handsomely in scenes set in Aya's working-class neighborhood, in her father's boss' chic mansion with its multiple living rooms, and during luminous nights some of the youngsters spend at the Thousand Star Hotel--that is, the nocturnally deserted market square. References to the period's worldwide hit TV show, <i>Dallas</i>; the aural backdrop of French pop music; and the cast's Ivorian traditional garments given a disco-twist vivify the rich cultural mixture of Western and newly independent African elements that <i>Aya</i> depicts. Abouet's storytelling is straightforward but gently nuanced, while Oubrerie's cartooning mixes sepia with bright hues that seem to reflect the ambient sunlight. <i>Francisca Goldsmith</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The multitude of vibrant images by Kenji Miura of green fields, a traditional farmhouse, antique baskets, and ceramic bowls filled with beautiful, simple dishes are interwoven with Japanese indigo fabrics to convey an intimate, authentic portrait of life and food on a Japanese farm.

Unlike the farm-to-table life as we know it here, where precious farm foods are cooked with recipes, often with some elaboration, real farm food means eating the same thing day after day when it&#x2019;s plentiful, putting it up for when it's not, and cooking it very, very simply because the farm demands so much more time in the field than in the kitchen.

Thank you, Nancy, for sharing your rich, intentional and truly inspiring life." --Deborah Madison<br><br>"Nancy Hachisu&#x2019;s amazing depth of knowledge of Japanese food and culture shines through in every part of this book.

It's a Japan that used to be, not the modern Japan defined by the busyness of Tokyo, but a more timeless place, a place whose rhythms are set by seasons and traditions and the work of the farm. <i>Japanese Farm Food</i> is so much more than a cookbook. This book has soul. Every vegetable, every tool has a story. Who grew this eggplant? Who made this soy sauce? Nancy doesn't have to ask, "Where does my food come from?" She knows. Here's a woman who grows and harvests her own rice, grain by grain. Not that she asks or expects us to do the same at all. What she does offer is a glimpse into her life in rural Japan, with its shoji screens and filtered light, and recipes from her farm kitchen that you can't wait to try." --Elise Bauer, SimplyRecipes.com<br><br>"Japanese Farm Food is a lovely book about the culture, landscape, and food of Japan, a true insider's view of the Japanese kitchen, from farm to table, by a passionate and talented writer." --Michael Ruhlman</p><p>Native Californian Nancy Singleton Hachisu has lived with her Japanese farmer husband and three sons in their 80-year old traditional farmhouse for the last 27 years in rural Japan, where she served as the leader of a local Slow Food convivium for more than a decade.

Enter "Skim," aka Kimberly Keiko Cameron, a not-slim, would-be Wiccan goth. When her classmate Katie Matthews is dumped by her boyfriend, who then kills himself, the entire school goes into mourning overdrive. It's a weird time to fall in love, but Skim does just that after secret meetings with her neo-hippie English teacher, Ms. Archer. When Ms. Archer abruptly leaves the school, Skim has to cope with her confusion and isolation, as her best friend, Lisa, tries to pull her into "real" life by setting up a hilarious double date for the school's semi-formal. Skim finds an unexpected ally in Katie. Suicide, depression, love, being gay or not, crushes, cliques of popular, manipulative peers &#x2014; the whole gamut of tortured teen life is explored in this masterful graphic novel by cousins Mariko and Jillian Tamaki.</p><p>Mariko Tamaki is a Toronto-based writer, performer and playwight.

After her parents' divorce, she turns to tarot cards and Wicca to make sense of life but finds herself disappointed with the lack of answers they provide. She finds herself increasingly intrigued by Ms. Archer, her free-spirited English teacher. Her interest becomes obsessive and it begins to drive a wedge between her and her best friend, Lisa. Although Skim originally makes light of the half-hearted suicide attempts of popular Katie, whose ex-boyfriend committed suicide, the two of them begin to open up to one another. Skim soon realizes that perfect Katie is far funnier, more genuine, and more traumatized than she originally thought&#x2013;particularly when it comes to light that John shot himself due to his homosexuality. Drawn in an expressive, fluid style and with realistic dialogue, this work accurately depicts the confusion of teenage years, with its rejection of previous identity and past relationships and search for a newer and truer identity; additionally, insider/outsider status is a reoccurring theme. Skim's internal monologue is diarylike, with an interesting use of scratched-out words. This is a good but somewhat standard work.<i>&#x2013;Dave Inabnitt, Brooklyn Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A strange haze is seen drifting through town on that first night, the night the trouble begins. It arrives like weather, or like smoke, some say later, but no one can locate any fire. Some blame the drought, which has been bleeding away the lake for years, and browning the air with dust.<br><br>Whatever this is, it comes over them quietly: a sudden drowsiness, a closing of the eyes. Most of the victims are found in their beds.<br><br>But there are some who will tell you that this sickness is not entirely new, that its cousins have sometimes visited ours. In certain letters from earlier centuries, you may find the occasional reference&#x2014;�decades apart&#x2014;�to a strange kind of slumber, a mysterious, persistent sleep.<br><br>In 1935, two children went to bed in a Dust Bowl cabin and did not wake for nine days. Some similar contagion once crept through a Mexican village&#x2014;�El Niente, they called it: &#x201c;the Nothing.&#x201d; And three thousand years before that, a Greek poet described a string of strange deaths in a village near the sea: they died, he wrote, as if overcome by sleep&#x2014;�or, according to a second translation: as if drowned in a dream.<br><br>This time, it starts at the college.<br><br>It starts with a girl leaving a party. She feels sick, she tells her friends, like a fever, she says, like the flu. And tired, too, as tired as she has ever felt in her life.<br><br>chapter 2.<br><br>The girl&#x2019;s roommate, Mei, will later recall waking to the sound of the key turning in the lock. Mei will remember the squeak of the springs in the dark as her roommate&#x2014;�her name is Kara&#x2014;�climbs into the bunk above hers. She seems drunk, this girl, the way she moves so slowly from door to bed, but the room is dim, and&#x2014;�as usual&#x2014;�they do not speak.<br><br>In the morning, Mei sees that Kara has slept in her clothes. The narrow black heels of her boots are sticking out beneath the blankets of the upper bunk. But Mei has seen her do this once before. She is careful not to wake her as she dresses. She is quiet with her keys and with the door. Mei leaves only the lightest possible impression on this space&#x2014;�the comfort of not being seen.<br><br>This is California, Santa Lora, six weeks into Mei&#x2019;s freshman year.<br><br>Mei stays away from the room all day. She feels better this way, still stunned by how quickly it happened, how the friendships formed without her, a thick and sudden ice.<br><br>Each evening, Kara and the other girls on the floor stand in towels in the bathroom, blocking the sinks as they lean toward the mirrors to line their lips and eyes. Mei can hear them laughing from the desk in her room across the hall, their voices loud above the hum of the blow-�dryers.<br><br>&#x201c;It takes time to get to know people,&#x201d; her mother says over the phone. &#x201c;Sometimes it takes years.&#x201d;<br><br>But there are certain stories that Mei has not told her mother. Like those boys who came to the door the first week of school. There was a bad smell in the hall, they&#x2019;d said, and they&#x2019;d tracked it to this room. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like something died in here,&#x201d; they&#x2019;d said, walking in without asking, filling up the narrow room, flip-�flops and board shorts, baseball caps low on their heads.<br><br>The boys got excited when they began to sniff around Mei&#x2019;s desk. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; they&#x2019;d said, pressing their hands to their noses. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s gotta be something in there.&#x201d; They&#x2019;d pointed to the bottom drawer. &#x201c;What the hell do you have in there?&#x201d;<br><br>It was her mother&#x2019;s dried cod, which had arrived in the company of three bars of dark chocolate and two lavender soaps.<br><br>&#x201c;My mom makes it,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said. This is one of her mother&#x2019;s few inheritances from her own mother, Mei&#x2019;s grandmother, the only one in the family born in China and not San Diego. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fish.&#x201d;<br><br>She knows that these boys refer to her as quiet girl, as in Hey, quiet girl, it&#x2019;s okay to talk. She does not think of herself that way, as especially quiet, but there she was, as if under their sway: suddenly not talking.<br><br>&#x201c;Jesus,&#x201d; said the one named Tom, who is taller than the others and plays basketball for the school team. He&#x2019;d tied a red bandanna around his face, like a worker in a Civil War hospital. &#x201c;That is foul,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Every time she remembers it, that bandanna over his mouth, Mei&#x2019;s face turns hot with the shame of it.<br><br>In the end, she dropped the bag of cod down the trash chute at the end of the hall, ten floors down, the scrape of plastic on tin, while the boys gathered around her to make sure.<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know they&#x2019;d be like that,&#x201d; Kara said later. This is how she learned that Kara was the one who told the boys about a smell in the room, though she&#x2019;d said nothing at all to Mei.<br><br>This is one of the reasons that Mei spends her afternoons at a campus caf�, where, on this particular day in October, she waits until she is sure her roommate and the other girls will be gone from the floor, their hair dryers quiet, their flat-�irons cool, and the girls themselves enmeshed by then in the complicated rituals of their sororities. The boys, she hopes, will be at dinner.<br><br>But when Mei gets back to the floor that night, nine hours after she left it, she finds a note, written in red, on the whiteboard that hangs on their door. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re leaving,&#x201d; it says. &#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d; These words&#x2014;�it is obvious&#x2014;�are meant for her roommate.<br><br>When Mei unlocks the door, she finds Kara still lying where she left her that morning, her body curled toward the wall in the top bunk, her black boots still protruding from the sheets.<br><br>&#x201c;Kara?&#x201d; she says softly. Outside, the sun is sinking. The sky is clear and turning pink. Mei switches on the overhead light. &#x201c;Kara?&#x201d; she says again.<br><br>But Kara does not wake. Not to the sound of Mei&#x2019;s pleading, or to the louder voices of the two paramedics who soon detect&#x2014;�through her badly wrinkled dress&#x2014;�that she is breathing, at least, that she still has a pulse.<br><br>Kara sleeps through the screaming of the other girls as they see the way her head rolls back against the stretcher, the way her mouth hangs open, her brown hair falling loose across her face. She sleeps through the screeching of the crickets in the pine trees outside, and through the cool night air on her skin.<br><br>Mei stands barefoot on the sidewalk as the paramedics slide the stretcher into the bright bubble of the ambulance, a little roughly, thinks Mei. Be careful, she wants to say. And then the doors swing shut without her, leaving Mei alone in the street.<br><br>The paramedics will later report that the girl sleeps through the wail of the siren, too, and the flashing of the lights. She sleeps through the bumps of the potholed streets as the ambulance rushes toward St. Mary&#x2019;s, where, after several attempts, two doctors find that they cannot wake her, either.<br><br>On the other floors of the hospital that night, women labor while the girl sleeps. Babies are born while she sleeps. She sleeps while an old man dies in a distant room, an expected death&#x2014;�his family gathered, a chaplain.<br><br>She sleeps through sunrise, and she sleeps through sunset.<br><br>And yet, in those first few hours, the doctors can find nothing else wrong. She looks like an ordinary girl sleeping ordinary sleep.<br><br>There will be some confusion, later, about what happened to her there, how her heart could have slowed so much without setting off the monitors. But this much is known to be true: over the course of many hours, her shallow breaths turn gradually shallower.<br><br>It is hard to say afterward why the final beats of her heart go unrecorded by those machines.<br><br>chapter 3.<br><br>The girls: they cry and cry, and they do not sleep. They sit around in their slippers and their sweats on the hard carpet of one another&#x2019;s rooms. They hold hands. They drink tea. If only they had checked on her sooner, they think. If only they had listened when she said she felt sick. They should have known, is the feeling. They should have done something. Maybe, they think, they could have saved her.<br><br>The boys turn quiet and they drink even more&#x2014;�cheap beer bought with fake IDs. They keep their hands in their pockets those first few days and just try to stay out of the way of the girls. It is as if the boys can sense it, even in those girls, in their easy closeness and their interlocking arms: the whole history of women and suffering, the generations of practice at grief.<br><br>To the girls, it feels wrong to get dressed. It feels wrong to wear makeup. Hair goes unwashed and legs go unshaven and contacts float untouched in solution. They wear glasses, it is then revealed to the boys. More than half of those girls wear glasses.<br><br>Her poor mother, the girls say to one another, their knees clutched tight to their chests, as if the shock has turned them even younger. They picture their own mothers. They imagine the phones ringing in their own kitchens, back home, in other towns in other states: Arizona, Nebraska, Illinois. I can&#x2019;t imagine it, the girls say to one another, I just can&#x2019;t imagine.<br><br>The funeral is in Kansas. It&#x2019;s too far to go.<br><br>&#x201c;We should do something for her parents,&#x201d; says one of the girls. They are coming the next day, the girls have heard, to collect Kara&#x2019;s things. &#x201c;We should order flowers.&#x201d;<br><br>The girls all agree right away. There is an intense desire to do the proper thing. This feels like their induction. Suddenly, here is life, cut right to its center. Here it is, dismantled to its bones.<br><br>They settle on lilies, two dozen, in white. Everyone signs the card.<br><br>They can think of nothing else useful to do, but a certain yearning persists. Meanwhile, a new generosity flows between them. How small their other concerns begin to seem, how meaningless, compared. Fights end, and slights are forgiven, and two of the girls reconcile by phone with the faraway boys who they loved so much in high school and who they had thought, until now, they&#x2019;d outgrown.<br><br>But still, the girls want something more. They long to be of use.<br><br>When Mei walks down the hall, her arms crossed and her head down and her black hair pulled tight into a braid, the girls notice her as they have never noticed her before.<br><br>She shouldn&#x2019;t blame herself, they all agree. None are sure of her name, the Chinese girl, or maybe Japanese, who lived in the same room as Kara. There is no way she could have known that Kara needed help.<br><br>&#x201c;We should tell her that it&#x2019;s not her fault,&#x201d; one of them whispers. &#x201c;We should tell her that she shouldn&#x2019;t feel bad.&#x201d;<br><br>But they stay where they are.<br><br>&#x201c;Does she speak En�glish?&#x201d; says another.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course she does,&#x201d; says another one. &#x201c;I think she&#x2019;s from here, right?&#x201d;<br><br>Somewhere, from another room, there floats the smell of microwave popcorn. No one is going to class.<br><br>The basket of lilies arrives that afternoon, but it is less than the girls had hoped, unable, in the end, to accomplish what they had wanted, which is to convey what they can say in no other way, something essential for which they do not know the words.<br><br>Kara&#x2019;s parents: their faces are pale and hollowed. She is a woman in a gray sweater. She is Kara with different skin. The father wears a beard and a flannel shirt. He is a man who thirty years earlier might have been any one of those boys of the floor, slouching in a doorframe, his hands in his pockets like theirs, unaware of what is waiting up ahead.<br><br>Slowly, they begin to pack their daughter&#x2019;s things.<br><br>The girls grow shy at the sight of them. They hide out in their rooms, afraid to say the wrong thing. For a while, the only sound on the floor is the harsh crack of packing tape, torn from its dispenser, or sometimes the clinking of emptied hangers, the soft slip of dresses being packed into boxes.<br><br>Watching those parents from afar, the girls are quick to mistake all the ordinary signs of midlife&#x2014;�those wrinkles in his forehead, those dark circles beneath her eyes&#x2014;�for evidence of grief instead of age. And maybe, in a way, the girls are right: those faces are proof of the passage of years, and it is the passage of years that has led them right here to this task.<br><br>The voices of Kara&#x2019;s parents are hoarse and wispy, as if they were the ones who were sick. Once, a sudden gasp comes from the mother&#x2019;s throat, &#x201c;Stop it, Richard,&#x201d; she says, and she begins to sob. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re ripping it.&#x201d;<br><br>This is the moment when Mei peeks out at the parents, as if watching from a great distance, which, in a way, she is.<br><br>The father is struggling to roll up one of Kara&#x2019;s posters. It&#x2019;s Paris, black-and-white, tacked to the wall with pushpins, and bought, Mei knows, from the campus bookstore the first week of school. So familiar has the poster become to Mei that she has begun to associate Kara with the girls in the photograph, laughing and glamorous on a cobblestone street in the rain.<br><br>&#x201c;Just stop touching it,&#x201d; the mother says to the father. &#x201c;Please.&#x201d;<br><br>After that, the father is quiet.<br><br>Mei lingers in the hallway. She should introduce herself to these parents, that&#x2019;s what her mother would say.<br><br>But there is something unbearable about the way that man looks out the window, so like Mei&#x2019;s own father would, and how he doesn&#x2019;t seem to know where to put his hands. It is in the way he keeps touching his beard, the way he stands so silently in the corner of that room.<br><br>Mei hurries back to her new room without speaking to them.<br><br>Only Caleb is brave enough to approach Kara&#x2019;s parents. Caleb, tall and skinny, brown hair and freckles. Caleb, the En�glish major, a little more serious than the other boys.<br><br>The girls watch him shake hands with Kara&#x2019;s father. They watch the way he holds his Cubs cap at his side while he speaks to Kara&#x2019;s mother. And the girls&#x2014;�every one of them&#x2014;�long to smooth his hair, which is sticking up on one side and sweaty from where the cap has been.<br><br>The girls love him right then for talking to those parents. They love him for knowing what to do.</p><h2>How to Draw Plants: The Techniques of Botanical Illustration</h2><p>Discusses the basic equipment and materials of botanical illustration and describes methods of drawing plants and flowers with botanical accuracy</p><p>The best introductory book on the subject examines plant structures and the problems they present to illustrators, then discusses the artist&#39;s tools and how to use them: pencils, erasers, papers, brushes, watercolors, gouache, and acrylics.This comprehensive and authoritative handbook by an experienced botanical artist is intended for the people who ask those questions&#x2014;who want to portray plants and flowers with botanical accuracy: artists seeking to extent subjects, or amateurs with an interest in botany and natural history who want to record flowers that have given them pleasure.<br><br>The author gives detailed advice on working in pencil, pen, scraper board, water-colour and gouache, and acrylics; on building up a drawing or painting by stages; on taking measurements and understanding plant structure; on collecting, handling and preserving plant material; and on the use of the hand lens and dissecting microscope.

The lifelong monetary problems experienced by his "poor dad" (whose weekly paychecks, while respectable, were never quite sufficient to meet family needs) pounded home the counterpoint communicated by his "rich dad" (that "the poor and the middle class work for money," but "the rich have money work for them"). Taking that message to heart, Kiyosaki was able to retire at 47. <i>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</i>, written with consultant and CPA Sharon L. Lechter, lays out his the philosophy behind his relationship with money. Although Kiyosaki can take a frustratingly long time to make his points, his book nonetheless compellingly advocates for the type of "financial literacy" that's never taught in schools. Based on the principle that income-generating assets always provide healthier bottom-line results than even the best of traditional jobs, it explains how those assets might be acquired so that the jobs can eventually be shed. <i>--Howard Rothman</i>Robert T.

By the author of Dissolution. 25,000 first printing.</p><p><p> <b>C. J. Sansom</b>, the internationally bestselling author ofthe novels<i>Winter in Madrid</i>and<i>Dominion</i>andthe Matthew Shardlake Tudor Mystery series,earned a Ph.D. in history and was a lawyer before becoming a full-time writer.</p>Matthew Shardlake, the marvelous hunchbacked 16th-century attorney who first appeared in Sansom's <i>Dissolution</i>, returns in this spellbinding Tudor-era tale of murder, conspiracy and betrayal. Shardlake normally handles property cases and the occasional dangerous mission for Lord Thomas Cromwell, the king's high counselor. Now he is engaged to defend a young woman accused of a curious murder, and the case seems hopeless. The girl refuses to speak and, under English law, unless she offers a plea in court she will be slowly crushed to death. Cromwell offers Shardlake a two-week stay of execution if he will agree to undertake a secret mission. Desperate to save the girl's life, Shardlake agrees. Rumors abound of a new and terrifying weapon called Greek Fire, and Cromwell orders Shardlake to find it, along with its secret formula and the two alchemists who possess it. Before Shardlake can even speak to the alchemists, they are brutally murdered, the formula and Greek Fire go missing, and horror and death are unleashed. Fortunately, Shardlake is aided by Jack Barak, a capable rogue working for Cromwell, and his old friend, Guy Malton, a peculiar apothecary. Sansom's vivid portrayal of squalid, stinking, bustling London; the city's wealth and poverty; the brutality and righteousness of religious persecution; and the complexities of English law make this a suspenseful, colorful and compelling tale. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But Lakewalkers keep their uncanny secrets&#x2014;and themselves&#x2014;from the farmers they protect, so when patroller Dag Redwing Hickory rescued farmer girl Fawn Bluefield, neither expected to fall in love, join their lives in marriage, or defy both their kin to seek new solutions to the perilous split between their peoples.</p><p>As Dag's maker abilities have grown, so has his concern about who&#x2014;or what&#x2014;he is becoming. At the end of a great river journey, Dag is offered an apprenticeship to a master groundsetter in a southern Lakewalker camp.

They begin with the fearsome figure of Joseph Stalin, who was driven by the dual dream of a Communist revolution and a global empire. They reveal the scope and limits of Stalin's ambitions by taking us into the world of his closest subordinates, the ruthless and unimaginative foreign minister Molotov and the Party's chief propagandist, Zhdanov, a man brimming with hubris and missionary zeal. The authors expose the machinations of the much-feared secret police chief Beria and the party cadre manager Malenkov, who tried but failed to set Soviet policies on a different course after Stalin's death. Finally, they document the motives and actions of the self-made and self-confident Nikita Khrushchev, full of Russian pride and party dogma, who overturned many of Stalin's policies with bold strategizing on a global scale. The authors show how, despite such attempts to change Soviet diplomacy, Stalin's legacy continued to divide Germany and Europe, and led the Soviets to the split with Maoist China and to the Cuban missile crisis.</p><p>Zubok and Pleshakov's groundbreaking work reveals how Soviet statesmen conceived and conducted their rivalry with the West within the context of their own domestic and global concerns and aspirations. The authors persuasively demonstrate that the Soviet leaders did not seek a conflict with the United States, yet failed to prevent it or bring it to conclusion. They also document why and how Kremlin policy-makers, cautious and scheming as they were, triggered the gravest crises of the Cold War in Korea, Berlin, and Cuba. Taking us into the corridors of the Kremlin and the minds of its leaders, Zubok and Pleshakov present intimate portraits of the men who made the West fear, to reveal why and how they acted as they did.</p></p><p>The Cold War hovered over Americans like a black cloud for more than 40 years. But with the defeat of Communism in 1991, documents have been released indicating that the United States might have avoided it. Vladislav Zubok and Constantine Plashakov reveal that high-level Soviet diplomats advised Stalin to abandon global confrontation for a partnership with the United States and Britain to prevent Germany&#39;s resuscitation and to help in the Soviet Union&#39;s reconstruction. Though FDR&#39;s death and Winston Churchill&#39;s electoral defeat complicated the plan, it was the Hiroshima bombing under Truman that severed relations. Though later Soviet attempts to reconcile were thwarted by Khruschev&#39;s hope for a Russian revolution, the authors remind us that Russia&#39;s course does not depend on Russia alone.Using recently uncovered archival materials, personal interviews, and a broad familiarity with Russian history and culture, two young Russian historians have written a major interpretation of the Cold War as seen from the Soviet shore. Covering the volatile period from 1945 to 1962, Zubok and Pleshakov explore the personalities and motivations of the key people who directed Soviet political life and shaped Soviet foreign policy.

These words ease the reader into the elegant, dreamlike world of Randall Jarrell's Newbery Honor book <i>The Animal Family</i>. One night, the lonely hunter hears the singing of a mermaid, and because "he himself was as patient as an animal," the mermaid learns to trust him, speaking to him in a voice like the water. In time they teach each other their languages, with many amusing exchanges occurring as the hunter tries to teach his new friend terrestrial words and concepts. The hunter explains, "The house is a big wooden thing ... that you stay inside at night or when it rains." "Why?" she asks. "To keep from getting wet." "To keep from getting <i>wet</i>?" the mermaid says despairingly. <p> The mermaid and the hunter become a family when the hunter takes a bear cub from its mother to live with them as a son. "The bear's table manners were bad. But so were the mermaid's--especially as she couldn't resist throwing the bear pieces of fish." Having a bear around seems perfectly normal, but not quite a complete family, so eventually the hunter captures a spotted baby lynx. When the lynx brings home not another dead partridge, but a little boy, the delicate, playful family dynamics change again. This book of low-key epiphanies is packed with delightful, illuminating, often unexpected comparisons of the ocean world and the land world most non-mermaids wouldn't have considered. Enhanced by a beautiful design and gorgeous illustrations by Maurice Sendak, this book is perfect for any reader--young or old--ready for a bit of gentle philosophy with a decided twinkle.

In distant Winchester, however, a knight has been murdered. Could it be because he was a supporter of the Empress Maud, one of numerous pretenders to the throne? It&#39;s up to herbalist, sleuth, and Benedictine monk Brother Cadfael to track down the killer in the pious throng.</p><p>ELLIS PETERS (1913-1995) was the nom de crime of English novelist Edith Pargeter, author of scores of books under her own name. She was a recipient of the Silver Dagger Award and the Cartier Diamond Dagger Award, conferred by the Crime Writers Association in Britain, as well as the coveted Edgar, awarded by the Mystery Writers of America.This entry in Peters&#39;s Brother Cadfael series finds the sixteenth-century monk hosting pilgrims who have traveled to Shrewsbury to commemorate the translation of St. Winifred&#39;s bones to the Benedictine abbey. The murder of a knight has political implications which reach Cadfael and involve him and some of the pilgrims in a mystery. Stephen Thorne, who has recorded several of Cadfael&#39;s adventures from Chivers, skillfully evokes the time and place with a fully voiced performance. Although the political and historical background presented as conversations in the opening pages results in a slow start, the story, intriguing characters and atmosphere soon captivate the listener.

After examining the clues, Enola discovers Lady Cecily is being held hostage in an abysmal orphanage, and if she isn?t rescued, she?ll be forced into a miserable marriage! This complicated case has Sherlock and Enola (literally) running into each other all over London. If Enola joins forces with the brother she has fought desperately to elude, she risks her freedom?yet, if she doesn?t, Lady Cecily could be doomed! Edgar Award?winning Nancy Springer offers the riskiest case yet for our well-loved, critically acclaimed heroine.</p><p><b>Nancy Springer</b> has published forty novels for adults, young adults and children. In a career beginning shortly after she graduated from Gettysburg College in 1970, Springer wrote for ten years in the imaginary realms of mythological fantasy, then ventured on contemporary fantasy, magical realism, and women's fiction before turning her attention to children's literature. Her novels and stories for middle-grade and young adults range from contemporary realism, mystery/crime, and fantasy to her critically acclaimed novels based on the Arthurian mythos, I AM MORDRED: A TALE OF CAMELOT and I AM MORGAN LE FAY. Springer's children's books have won her two Edgar Allan Poe awards, a Carolyn W. Field award, various Children's Choice honors and numerous ALA Best Book listings. Her most recent series include the Tales of Rowan Hood, featuring Robin Hood&#x2019;s daughter, and the Enola Holmes mysteries, starring the much younger sister of Sherlock Holmes. <p>Ms. Springer lives in East Berlin, Pennsylvania.</p>Grade 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes's 14-year-old sister takes on a new case, this one involving Lady Cecily Alistair, the champion of the poor and working classes of London. The Holmes brothers continue to be concerned about Enola's lack of a "proper" upbringing and she continues to evade them by disguising herself as Ivy Meshle, secretary to the nonexistent Dr. Leslie Ragostin. Enola finds that Lady Cecily is being held against her will, at her father's behest, by her two dragon-lady aunts to be married off to her foppish cousin. The girl employs numerous clever disguises, is found detecting by Sherlock, and narrowly escapes with her life. Springer's knowledge of the restraints placed on Victorian women, especially those of the upper classes, is used both for humorous entertainments (a pink tea) and to give authenticity to Enola's determination to remain an independent young lady. Her fans will welcome this latest adventure.&#x2014;<i>Kathryn Kosiorek, formerly at Cuyahoga County Public Library, Brooklyn, OH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

We constantly beat ourselves up over our failures and in the process drive ourselves away from God, who we subconsciously believe tallies our failures and hangs His head in disappointment. Nothing could be further from the truth. Even as ragamuffins, the Father beckons us to Him with a &#34;furious love&#34; that burns brightly for His children. It is a gift like no other. It is only when we truly realize God&#39;s grace that we can forever bask in the unbridled joy of a gospel that enfolds the most needy of His ragamuffins.</p><p>Brennan Manning wrote <i>The Ragamuffin Gospel</i> "for the bedraggled, beat-up, and burnt-out," the marginalized folks to whom Jesus ministered: the children, the ill, the tax collectors, the women. In other words, the ragamuffins. Manning understands better than most that behind our facades of order and self-assurance are inadequacies that can find healing only in Jesus. While the powerful and religious elite challenged him, Jesus embraced and healed and fed the needs of the ragamuffins. Jesus delivered love, healing, and, most of all, grace.<p> Grace is defined as "the freely given and unmerited favor and love of God." But, as Manning points out, we have "twisted the gospel of grace into religious bondage and distorted the image of God into an eternal, small-minded bookkeeper." In reality, God offers us grace immeasurable. Brennan Manning gently encourages us to embrace that grace in the face of our greatest needs. And Manning certainly knows whereof he speaks, having taken a journey from priesthood and academic achievement through a collapse into alcoholism. Manning came face to face with his need, finally abandoning himself to grace. And he invites us now to join him in a life of grace.</p><p> Manning is without doubt one of the most eloquent writers on the subject of grace because he openly shares his own pain and struggle to help readers deal with failure and inadequacy. And he sweetly challenges them to do the same. <i>--Patricia Klein</i></p><b>Brennan Manning </b>is a Korean War veteran and former Franciscan priest who lives in New Orleans , Louisiana .

Gresham Machen (The Swans Are Not Silent, Book 4)</h2><p><p>Athanasius. John Owen. J. Gresham Machen.</p> <p>Each of these men stood for the truth of God's Word in the face of opposition-all out of a deep love for Christ and a desire for people to know God in his fullness. Popularity was not a concern, and they took no joy in controversy for argument's sake. However, these men were willing to suffer for the sake of guarding the sanctity of the gospel. Many threats, years of exile, deaths of loved ones, opposition from friends and authorities, sickness and pain-none of these setbacks could keep these three from maintaining their efforts for the furthering of Christ's Kingdom or quench their zeal for Christ himself.</p> <p>In his fourth book of The Swans Are Not Silent series, <em>Contending for Our All</em>, John Piper has given us biographies of Athanasius, John Owen, and J. Gresham Machen-bishop, pastor, and seminary founder. In the life of each one, personal holiness was emphasized publicly and privately despite suffering. They were true soldiers for the sake of the cross, and each man offers life lessons for Christians today.</p> <p><b>Athanasius</b></p> <p>The deity of Christ and all its worth consumed Athanasius. He devoted his life to defending it. The great adversary was the Arian heresy. Athanasius would be banished by the emperor five times. He was contending for his all-the essential, life-giving truth of Christ and his gospel.</p> <p><b>John Owen</b></p> <p>Communion with Christ was the focus of John Owen's vast intellect and expansive heart. He battled Christ-belittling errors of the mind and heart with passion and skill. Going deeper in the understanding of Christ was for him the key to going deeper in fellowship with him.</p> <p><b>J. Gresham Machen</b></p> <p>Representing Christ in all his fullness with all of Scripture drove J. Gresham Machen. He saw in the liberal Christianity of the early twentieth century another religion. His exposure of its subtleties and his emphasis on the facts of history are astonishingly relevant for our time in the early twenty-first century.</p> <p><b>The Swans Are Not Silent</b></p> <p>When Augustine handed over the leadership of his church in A.D. 426, his successor was so overwhelmed by a sense of inadequacy that he declared, "The swan is silent," fearing the spiritual giant's voice would be lost to time. But for 1,600 years Augustine has not been silent-and neither have those who faithfully trumpeted the cause of Christ after him. Their lives have inspired every generation of believers and should compel us to a greater passion for God.</p></p><p><p><strong>John Piper</strong> (DTheol, University of Munich) is the founder and teacher of desiringGod.org&nbsp;and the chancellor of Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary.

Editors Bill Morgan and David Stanford shed new light on this intimate and influential friendship in this fascinating exchange of letters between Kerouac and Ginsberg, two thirds of which have never been published before. Commencing in 1944 while Ginsberg was a student at Columbia University and continuing until shortly before Kerouac's death in 1969, the two hundred letters included in this book provide astonishing insight into their lives and their writing. While not always in agreement, Ginsberg and Kerouac inspired each other spiritually and creatively, and their letters became a vital workshop for their art.

But amid this amazing secret animal world lies a danger that threatens not only the cats of the world, but humans as well.</p><p>Fantasy set in the universe Duane created in a YA series (Deep Wizardry, 1990, etc.). Cats are intelligent and have their own language, Ailurin; feline wizards with their human counterparts keep transit gates open and the world safe from disasters and invasions. Three New York wizards, house pet Rhiow, neurotic Saash, and dumpster resident Urruah, are detailed by the Powers That Be to repair a malfunctioning gate beneath Grand Central Station before a train accidentally gets hurled into another dimension. In the train tunnel the three battle hordes of rats and rescue a kitten, Arhu, who, though resentful and hostile, is destined to become a wizard, too. Next, the trio must travel into an alternate world of the past, Downside, to locate the gate's power source--but the locals are dinosaurs, and very belligerent. Then the investigators' human Area Advisory vanishes; they discover a magic spell written in Ailurin on an ancient Egyptian papyrus; Arhu develops a talent for seeing the future; and it becomes clear that they're being opposed by a dinosaur wizard backed by the evil Lone Power. Often intriguing, with a well-worked backdrop, but it's hard to find a logical or emotional connection between cats and dinosaurs.

Long has also served on the board of directors of the International Association for Near-Death Studies and established the nonprofit Near Death Experience Research Foundation and the NDERF website.</p>Long states bluntly that the "so-called Texas Revolution was designed only to wrench a huge chunk of Mexican territory free of Mexican control long enough for the United States to annex it." How the Anglo-Americans accomplished it is the subject of this dramatic revisionist look at the 1835-1836 war for Texan independence. The book emphasizes the white revolutionaries' racist contempt for and brutalization of the indigenous population, and the savagery on both sides during the military engagements at Gonzales, the Alamo, Goliad and the decisive victory over Santa Anna's forces at San Jacinto. Sweeping aside stock legends of the war, Long ( Outlaw: The True Story of Claude Dallas ) roasts several famed figures, including Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie. The commander of the Alamo garrison, William Travis, is portrayed as a syphilitic satyr unfit to lead men in battle. Sam Houston shows up as both an alcoholic and an opium addict. Texans will be outraged. Others are likely to enjoy this brazen debunking of sacred local myths. History Book Club dual main selection.

I could have given him a key, offered a piece of my floor. But if I let him inside the line between us would blur, my own slow-motion car wreck would speed up."</em> Nick Flynn met his father for the third time when he was twenty-seven years old, working as a caseworker in a homeless shelter in Boston. As a teenager he'd received letters from this stranger, a self-proclaimed poet and con man doing time in federal prison for bank robbery. Nick, his own life precariously unsettled, was living alternately in a ramshackle boat and in a warehouse that was once a strip joint. In bold, dazzling prose, <em>Another Bullshit Night in Suck City</em> (a phrase Flynn senior uses to describe his life on the streets) tells the story of two lives and the trajectory that led Nick and his father into that homeless shelter, onto those streets, and finally to each other.</p><p>Nick Flynn is the author of three previous memoirs, including the PEN/Joyce Osterweil Award&#x2013;winning Another Bullshit Night in Suck City, and four volumes of poetry.

Nelson Mandela, who died in 2013 at the age of ninety-five, is the closest thing the world has to a secular saint. He liber�ated a country from a system of violent prejudice and helped unite oppressor and oppressed in a way that had never been done before. <br><br>Now Richard Stengel, the editor of <i>Time </i>maga�zine, has distilled countless hours of intimate conver�sation with Mandela into fifteen essential life lessons. For nearly three years, including the critical period when Mandela moved South Africa toward the first democratic elections in its history, Stengel collaborated with Mandela on his autobiography, <i>Long Walk to Freedom</i>,&nbsp;and traveled with him everywhere. Eating with him, watching him campaign, hearing him think out loud, Stengel came to know all the different sides of this complex man and became a cherished friend and colleague. <br><br>In <i>Mandela&#x2019;s Way, </i>Stengel recounts the moments in which &#x201c;the grandfather of South Africa&#x201d; was tested and shares the wisdom he learned: why courage is more than the absence of fear, why we should keep our rivals close, why the answer is not always either/or but often &#x201c;both,&#x201d; how important it is for each of us to find something away from the world that gives us pleasure and satisfaction&#x2014;our own garden. Woven into these life lessons are remarkable stories&#x2014;of Mandela&#x2019;s child�hood as the prot�g� of a tribal king, of his early days as a freedom fighter, of the twenty-seven-year imprison�ment that could not break him, and of his fulfilling remarriage at the age of eighty.<br><br>This uplifting book captures the spirit of this extraordinary man&#x2014;warrior, martyr, husband, statesman, and moral leader&#x2014;and spurs us to look within ourselves, reconsider the things we take for granted, and contemplate the legacy we&#x2019;ll leave behind.</p><p>Richard Stengel<b> </b>is the<b> </b>former editor of TIME. He collaborated with Nelson Mandela on his bestselling 1993 autobiography, <i>Long Walk to Freedom, </i>and later served as coproducer of the 1996 Oscar-nominated documentary <i>Mandela</i>. He is also the author of <i>January Sun: One Day, Three Lives, a South African Town</i>. Stengel is married to Mary Pfaff, and they have two sons.Richard Stengel, an editor at TIME magazine, collaborated with Nelson Mandela on his autobiography, LONG WALK TO FREEDOM. He continues his fascination with the African civil rights leader with this homily on Mandela, which is loosely organized around 15 lessons. The book begins with a preface by Mandela, highly complimentary to Stengel, which Stengel delivers in a tone filled with admiration and what comes off as a bit of self-congratulation. The opening sets the tone of the narration, which is overpowering through many sections of the book. The work is strong enough to survive the distraction but would be better served by a narration that places less emphasis on the author&#39;s personal relationship with Mandela.

Nancy and Robert live in Michigan.The Wolgemuths (he's an author and owner of a literary agency; she's an author) and the DeVries (he's a pastor and author; she assists him in premarital counseling and marriage retreats) offer here a two-in-one, flip-over-format volume aimed at newlywed Christian couples. Recognizing the success of their own marriages, the authors decided to share their experiences and advice with couples in that make-or-break first year of marriage. Both "books" have the same layout and cover topics such as money, sex and in-laws, but they cater, thematically and tonally, to the gender of their audience. The man's chapter on sex, for instance, playfully employs a baseball metaphor throughout: the male authors fondly recall boyhood discussions of "getting to first base," and offer suggestions for how husbands can please and love their wives without immediately going for the "home run." The woman's sex chapter, on the other hand, skips the metaphors, and instead gently explains that communication is key in the first year, and that the wife needs to teach her husband how to satisfy her. The authors consider "normals"-things one spouse grew up thinking was natural but might seem strange to the other (such as the belief that no house is complete without "a really big dog," the conviction that husbands should make more money than their wives, or the assumption that being late is fine). Addressing these "normals" help spouses understand why their partners behave the way they do, which in turn can ease conflicts. Boldly, the authors address the sometimes controversial Biblical principle of submission: "No relationship, in fact, can succeed without submission," they claim. It needs to happen voluntarily (neither spouse can force their partner to submit), and when both people actively and humbly work to yield to each other, "the marriage always wins." And the secret ingredient to successful marriages? Friendship: "it is only in the fields of friendship that the long-term passion and intimacy you long for can grow and flourish." Each book is neatly wrapped up with a "Meet in the Middle" section, which offers questions and exercises the husband and wife can work through together to continue to build upon the lessons they've just learned. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>No Fond Return of Love</h2><p>Dulcie Mainwaring attends a conference, where she meets Professor Aylwin Forbes, who falls in love first with Dulcie&#39;s niece Laurel, and eventually with Dulcie herself</p><p>Barbara Pym is the twentieth-century literary heiress to Jane Austen, praised by the Huffington Post as &#x201c;the thinking girl&#x2019;s romance writer.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Barbara Pym Cookbook</i>, which shows readers how to recreate the English teas and dinners featured in Pym&#x2019;s fiction, is the perfect companion for devoted fans.Barbara Pym, who died on January 11, 1980, spent the last few years of her life in an Oxfordshire village, sharing a small cottage with her sister.

Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things one can best discover for oneself), <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> makes another good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male protagonist.<br> &nbsp;<br> After that: <i>Brothers in Arms</i> should be read before <i>Mirror Dance</i>, and both, ideally, before <i>Memory.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Komarr</i> makes another good alternate entry point for the series, picking up Miles's second career at its start.&nbsp; It should be read before <i>A Civil Campaign</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Borders of Infinity</i>, a collection of three of the five currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure sampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit themselves to length.&nbsp; (But it may make more sense if read after <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i>.)&nbsp; Take care not to confuse the collection-as-a-whole with its title story, "The Borders of Infinity".<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Falling Free</i> takes place 200 years earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with the main body of the series.&nbsp; Most readers recommend picking up this story later. It should likely be read before <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i>, however, which revisits the "quaddies", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in Miles's time.<br> &nbsp;<br> The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear in italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words and 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Falling Free</i><br> <i>Shards of Honor</i><br> <i>Barrayar</i><br> <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i><br> "The Mountains of Mourning"<br> "Weatherman"<br> <i>The Vor Game</i><br> <i>Cetaganda</i><br> <i>Ethan of Athos</i><br> <i>Borders of Infinity</i><br> "Labyrinth"<br> "The Borders of Infinity" <br> <i>Brothers in Arms</i><br> <i>Mirror Dance</i><br> <i>Memory</i><br> <i>Komarr</i><br> <i>A Civil Campaign</i><br> "Winterfair Gifts"<br> <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i><br> <i>Captain Vorpatril's Alliance</i><br> <i>CryoBurn</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Caveats:<br> &nbsp;<br> The novella "Weatherman" is an out-take from the beginning of the novel <i>The Vor Game</i>.&nbsp; If you already have <i>The Vor Game</i>, you likely don't need this.<br> &nbsp;<br> The original 'novel' <i>Borders of Infinity</i> was a fix-up collection containing the three novellas "The Mountains of Mourning", "Labyrinth", and "The Borders of Infinity", together with a frame story to tie the pieces together. Again, beware duplication.&nbsp; The frame story does not stand alone, and mainly is of interest to completists.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Fantasy Novels</b><br> &nbsp;<br> My fantasy novels are a bit easier to order.&nbsp; Easiest of all is <i>The Spirit Ring</i>, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed books that for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series.&nbsp; Next easiest are the four volumes of <i>The Sharing Knife--</i>in order, <i>Beguilement</i>, <i>Legacy</i>, <i>Passage</i>, and <i>Horizon--</i>which I broke down and actually numbered, as this was one continuous tale divided into non-wrist-breaking chunks.<br> &nbsp;<br> What have come to be called the Chalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written, like the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and can in theory be read in any order.&nbsp; (The third book actually takes place a few hundred years prior to the more closely connected first two.)&nbsp; Some readers think the world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in publication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the first (but not the third.)&nbsp; In any case, the publication order is:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Curse of Chalion</i><br> <i>Paladin of Souls</i><br> <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The short story collection <i>Proto Zoa</i> was an e-book experiment; it contains five very early tales--three (1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction--all previously published but not in this handy format.&nbsp; The novelette "Dreamweaver's Dilemma" may be of interest to Vorkosigan completists, as it is the first story in which that proto-universe began, mentioning Beta Colony but before Barrayar was even thought of. <br> &nbsp;<br> Happy reading!<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> -- Lois McMaster Bujold.Lois McMaster Bujold is one of the most honored writers in the fields of science fiction and fantasy and has won&nbsp;five Hugo Awards and three Nebula Awards, including a Nebula Award for <i>Falling Free</i>, included in <i>Miles, Mutants and Microbes</i>.

He is in his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As Harry and Ron embark on their journey to Hogwarts in a flying Ford Anglia, little do they know that this year will be just as eventful as the last as ghosts from Hogwarts past return to haunt the school corridors. The texts</p><p>It's hard to fall in love with an earnest, appealing young hero like Harry Potter and then to watch helplessly as he steps into terrible danger! And in J.K. Rowling's <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i>, the much anticipated sequel to the award-winning <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>, he is in terrible danger indeed. As if it's not bad enough that after a long summer with the horrid Dursleys he is thwarted in his attempts to hop the train to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to begin his second year. But when his only transportation option is a magical flying car, it is just his luck to crash into a valuable (but clearly vexed) Whomping Willow. Still, all this seems like a day in the park compared to what happens that fall within the haunted halls of Hogwarts. <p> Chilling, malevolent voices whisper from the walls only to Harry, and it seems certain that his classmate Draco Malfoy is out to get him. Soon it's not just Harry who is worried about survival, as dreadful things begin to happen at Hogwarts. The mysteriously gleaming, foot-high words on the wall proclaim, "The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir, Beware." But what exactly does it mean? Harry, Hermione, and Ron do everything that is wizardly possible--including risking their own lives--to solve this 50-year-old, seemingly deadly mystery. This deliciously suspenseful novel is every bit as gripping, imaginative, and creepy as the first; familiar student concerns--fierce rivalry, blush-inducing crushes, pedantic professors--seamlessly intertwine with the bizarre, horrific, fantastical, or just plain funny. Once again, Rowling writes with a combination of wit, whimsy, and a touch of the macabre that will leave readers young and old desperate for the next installment. (Ages 9 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>The Dursleys were so mean and hideous that summer that all Harry Potter wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.<br><br>And strike is does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageous stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny.<br><br>But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone--or something--starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects...Harry Potter himself?</p><h2>Rising Sun, Falling Skies: The disastrous Java Sea Campaign of World War II</h2><p>Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese offensive in the Far East seemed unstoppable. Allied forces engaged in a futile attempt to halt their rapid advance, culminating in the massed fleet of American, British, Dutch, and Australian forces (ABDA) clashing with the Japanese at the battle of the Java Sea - the first major sea battle of World War II in the Pacific. But, in a campaign crippled by poor leadership and disastrous decisions, the Allied response was catastrophic, losing their largest warships and their tenuous toe-hold in the south Pacific within the first 72 hours of the battle. This defeat left ground troops cut off from reinforcement and supply, with obsolete equipment, no defense against endless Japanese air attacks, and with no chance of retreat. However, although command decisions were to condemn the Allies to defeat, the Allied goal was never an outright victory, simply a delaying action. Facing a relentless and thoroughly vicious enemy, the combined forces responded not by running or surrendering, but by defiantly holding on in a struggle that was as much a test of character, bravery, and determination as it was a test of arms, ultimately costing the Allies ten vessels and the lives of 2,100 brave sailors. In Rising Sun, Falling Skies, Jeffrey Cox examines the events and evidence surrounding the Java Sea Campaign, reconstructing battles that in hindsight were all but hopeless and revealing where fatal mistakes and missed opportunities condemned the Allied forces in an insightful and compelling study of the largely overlooked clash in the Java Sea.</p><p>'In the Pacific War's first months, elements of four navies, Dutch, British, American, and Australian, fought a delaying action against superior Japanese forces as heroic as it was hopeless. Cox brings an attorney's incisiveness, a historian's comprehension, and a storyteller's passion to this compelling account of the Java Sea campaign. Rising Sun, Falling Skies commemorates not a defense but a defiance: a forgotten epic of character and honor.' - Dennis Showalter <br> 'A seminal work about a long neglected part of World War II in the Pacific... richly detailed with accounts from the men on both sides of the conflict who fought desperate struggles in 1942 either as conquerors or defenders.' --Mike Walling, author Forgotten Sacrifice and Bloodstained SeaAuthor Jeffrey Cox conducts a thorough and compelling investigation of the Java Sea Campaign, the first major sea battle of the Pacific War, which inflicted huge costs on the Allies and set the stage for Japan&#39;s rout across the Pacific and Indian oceans.</p><h2>The Reckoning (Maeve Kerrigan Novels)</h2><p>To the public, he&#x20ac;&#x2122;s a hero: a brutal killer who targets sex offenders.

The truth was, in fact, that it was like no other job in the world, except that there were good days and bad days. But the bad days were really, truly, epically bad. The bad days were spent standing too close to a decomposing body, trying not to gag. The bad days were random acts of violence on empty streets late at night with no witnesses. The bad days were domestic punch-ups that had got out of hand, dead drug addicts in dingy bedsits, elderly shut-ins whose neighbors only cared enough to call the police when the smell was too revolting to bear. I didn&#x2019;t care to count up how many days were bad ones; I suspected I wouldn&#x2019;t like the answer. But I could deal with it. I could cope.<br><br>I wasn&#x2019;t sure, however, that I could cope with my new case. More specifically, I wasn&#x2019;t sure that I could cope with my new boss. I wasn&#x2019;t at all sure I could stand it if all the days were bad, if every minute was another minute closer to breaking my spirit. I stared out of the car window as I half-listened to the driver beside me and wished I were somewhere else, with someone else.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t like me to be so unenthusiastic but nothing about my current situation was good. I was on my way to a crime scene I didn&#x2019;t want to face, accompanied by Detective Inspector Josh Derwent, one of two new additions to the team at that level. He and the other new DI, Keith Bryce, had worked with Godley before. That was about all they seemed to have in common. Bryce was quietly melancholy, and his face was as rumpled as his suits. Derwent was younger and had a reputation for being obsessively hard-working and infinitely aggressive. As far as I could tell, he liked fast driving, soft rock, and the sound of his own voice. Rumor had it he didn&#x2019;t like junior detectives to answer back. Handle with care was the advice circulating in the office, and I watched him covertly as he drove, heavy on the accelerator, heavy on the brake, swearing and spinning the wheel one-handed as if he were in a games arcade rather than pushing to make time on traffic-clogged London streets. Magic FM blared from the car radio, middle-of-the-road music at its most blandly inoffensive. Derwent sang along occasionally, unself-conscious even though he didn&#x2019;t know me at all. Not that I was likely to make anyone feel on edge, least of all him. I was the most junior of detective constables and he was an inspector, fifteen years in the job.<br><br>I had been prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. I had suffered enough from misplaced gossip, from the assumptions made about me based on my looks, my height, my youth, my name. So when Superintendent Godley summoned me to his office and I found Derwent there already, leaning up against the glass wall that separated the boss from the rest of us, I didn&#x2019;t expect trouble. I should have known better. Even someone as inexperienced as me knew that when the superintendent didn&#x2019;t meet your eyes, it was time to get nervous.<br><br>&#x201c;Maeve, you haven&#x2019;t met Josh Derwent yet, have you? He&#x2019;s taking the lead on a new job we&#x2019;ve picked up in Brixton&#x2014;a double murder, of sorts.&#x201d;<br><br>Derwent acknowledged me with a fleeting look, no smile. He was of average height but thick through the neck and shoulders, muscled like a bulldog. He was too rugged to be called handsome but his close-cropped hair, strong jaw and broken nose, and the tan he&#x2019;d earned while training for marathons, made him distinctive. You&#x2019;d certainly think twice before getting into a fight with him. The marathon running was a hobby that had raised eyebrows among my colleagues, most of whom counted a short jog to the vending machine as exercise. According to them, long-distance running was public masochism and a further sign that Derwent wasn&#x2019;t to be trusted. For my part, I couldn&#x2019;t work out how he found the time to train, but otherwise I didn&#x2019;t care. And he was certainly in great shape. It was really only the fact that he was standing in the same room with Superintendent Godley that made him look ordinary, but then there were comparatively few men who could measure up to the boss. Tall, with hair that had turned silver-white when he was still a young man, Godley was startlingly attractive. He must have been aware of the effect he had on people, but he seemed to be utterly without vanity. No one would dare to underestimate him because of his appearance; it was impossible to mistake what lay behind his brilliant blue eyes for anything but a sharp, focused intelligence.<br><br>But today, for some reason, the focus was off. Godley looked strained and sounded distracted, fumbling among his papers for the notes on the new case and not finding what he was looking for.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have the details to hand, but we&#x2019;ve got two men, both tortured to death, bodies found within a mile of each other in the last twenty-four hours. Josh, I know you want to get going, so tell DC Kerrigan what we know so far while you&#x2019;re on the way.&#x201d;<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t like Godley to be vague. One of the things that made him an outstanding boss was his command of each twist and turn in every case his team worked. I hesitated for a second before following Derwent out of the room. It wasn&#x2019;t my place to ask the superintendent if he was okay. Besides, I had problems of my own. Derwent could have looked more thrilled at the prospect of working with me. Maybe he had heard something about me from someone else on the team. Maybe I had made a bad first impression. Maybe he was just in a bad mood. Sitting next to him in the squad car, it was difficult to tell.<br><br>&#x201c;Earth to DC Kerrigan. Come in, DC Kerrigan.&#x201d;<br><br>I jumped. &#x201c;Sorry. I was miles away.&#x201d;<br><br>Derwent had interrupted his monologue about other motorists&#x2019; shortcomings to ask me a question, and I&#x2019;d missed it. He was looking at me impatiently, tapping his fingers on the edge of the steering wheel as the lights in front of us stubbornly stayed red.<br><br>&#x201c;I asked you what you made of Godley&#x2019;s briefing. I thought you might have some insight to share.&#x201d; The sarcasm was biting and I managed not to wince. Just.<br><br>&#x201c;The boss didn&#x2019;t say much. Only that there were two similar deaths in the same area.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And that didn&#x2019;t make you think? Didn&#x2019;t make you wonder what&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know enough about either case yet to make any assumptions,&#x201d; I said levelly. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to jump to conclusions without knowing the facts.&#x201d; <i>The facts you were supposed to share with me. . .&nbsp;</i><br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s fair.&#x201d; Derwent was nodding as if I&#x2019;d passed a test I didn&#x2019;t know I was taking. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s talk through the facts. Yesterday evening, Mrs. Claudia Tremlett called her local police station to report her husband missing. Ivan Tremlett was a self-employed software designer who lived in Clapham, just off the Common. He rented office space down the road in Brixton because he had three small children and they made too much noise for him to be able to work from home. He had two rooms above a laundrette and it was his habit to lock himself in. He was extremely security conscious, not least because he had quite a lot of expensive computer equipment. He didn&#x2019;t see clients at his office so he wasn&#x2019;t set up to receive visitors. Mrs. Tremlett became concerned when he failed to return home by six o&#x2019;clock, because he always followed the same routine&#x2014;out in the morning by half past eight, back by half past five. She had tried to raise him by phone, but got no reply from the mobile or landline. Mrs. Tremlett was extremely distressed on the phone and worried about her husband&#x2019;s safety. She convinced the sergeant to dispatch a unit to check that all was well.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And it wasn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said knowing the answer.<br><br>&#x201c;It was not. Mr. Tremlett was in the office, all right, with his computers, but neither they nor he were in what you might call a viable condition. Mr. Tremlett&#x2019;s injuries were not compatible with life.&#x201d;<br><br>It was typical police understatement: the phrase generally meant someone who was so very dead it was hard to recognize them as having been human in the first place. &#x201c;Who took the case? Lambeth CID?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They did the initial work. Didn&#x2019;t take it too far&#x2014;they just took statements from the people working in the laundrette, and Mrs. Tremlett, and secured the scene.

From an early age she was drawn to the teachings of Buddha and the rewards of a monastic life, but to please her family she agreed to walk the traditional path of marriage. </p><p>Throughout her marriage, Kinh Tam&#x2019;s mind was devoted to her husband but her heart never waivered from her true calling. She wanted to be a monk. And yet Buddhism was still new to Vietnam and temples accepted only men for ordination. Making a decision that would forever change her life, Kinh Tam left town, disguised herself as a man, and joined a monastery as a novice. </p><p>Despite the many challenges of living as a man, Kinh Tam thrived and became a beloved member of the community. Years of profound joy and peace passed until a local woman accuses the novice of fathering her unborn child. Kinh Tam is torn between two impossible choices: keep her secret and endure brutal punishment or reveal the truth that would prove her innocence but put an end to her spiritual path.</p><p>Facing the unbearable with the boundless heart of Buddha, her choice forever changes her life, her country, and her faith. </p><p>In spare, elegant prose, Thich Nhat Hanh reminds us that we, too, face our own injustices and suffering, and by connecting with love, we can, like Kinh Tam, discover a mind and heart that are peaceful, happy, and free. </p><p>Thich Nhat Hanh is a Vietnamese Buddhist Zen master, poet, scholar, and peace activist who was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He is the author of many books, including the classics <em>Peace Is Every Step</em> and <em>The Art of Power.</em> Hanh lives in Plum Village, his meditation center in France, and has led retreats worldwide on the art of mindful living.</p></p><h2>Men Who Met God</h2><p>A look at 7 Old Testament saints who had sometimes dramatic but alsways life-changing encounters with God.

Reprint.</p><p>Jill Rubalcaba, author of A PLACE IN THE SUN, UNCEGILA&#39;S SEVENTH SPOT, and ST. VITUS&#39; DANCE, lives in Haddam, Connecticut.Grade 3-6. When his sculptor father is bitten by a cobra, Senmut believes that if he can carve a statue of the healer-goddess Sekhmet that will please her, she will help save Yuf. But as the boy works, he carelessly throws aside a tool, accidentally killing a dove. This thoughtless act, in the ancient Egypt Rubalcaba has re-created, means a death sentence for Senmut, unless the gods intercede on his behalf. They do, and instead of a quick death, the boy is sentenced to work in the mines, which will lead, he knows, to a slower, but no-less-sure, demise. How the protagonist escapes this fate and, by virtue of his talent and some good luck, survives to become Royal Sculptor to the Pharaoh, makes for an exciting and information-filled adventure. The details of daily life, customs, and beliefs of the people are wonderfully revealed through the words and deeds of the characters. The story has enough excitement to capture the interest of most reluctant readers. While several of the events rely on coincidence, careful plotting and foreshadowing prepare readers for some of the ensuing action. The prologue, for example, is told from the cobra's perspective and cleverly sets the stage for what follows. The places and objects are so well described that they can be easily visualized by children unfamiliar with Egyptian artifacts. A substantial glossary helps to identify and explain unfamiliar terms. A fine story for enjoyment or as curriculum support for units on ancient Egypt.?Linda Greengrass, Bank Street College Library, New York City<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Fatal Hour: The Assassination of President Kennedy by Organized Crime</h2><p>Dramatic and timely, this detailed account reveals the facts about issues surrounding organized crime&#39;s vendetta against Kennedy--including the Chicago syndicate&#39;s involvement in his election, Robert Kennedy&#39;s relentless pursuit of the Mafia, Jim Garrison&#39;s relationship to organized crime, and much more. 8-page photo insert.

Originally published in 1969 when the combat experiences of the Vietnam War were still happening in real-time, <i>Thud Ridge</i> tells the frustrating tale of Air Force strike pilots who were thrust into the war in its early stages, and who had to literally write the book as they flew each dangerous and hair-raising mission. Jack Broughton is not only a fighter pilot s fighter pilot, but a gifted write who can put you right into the hot sweaty cockpit of a Republic F-105 Thunderchief flying its payload of 750-lb. bombs right up Route Pack 6 and into the heavily defended piece of real estate that gives this book its name. &nbsp; Now enhanced by compelling and candid photographs running chronologically through the narrative, this book not only tells the story of aerial bravery during the early phases of Vietnam, but gives the reader a veritable encyclopedia of information on all the combat hardware employed in the conflict. An appendix showing aircraft flown and equipment used in Southeast Asia offers the kind of detail that really puts this book into proper historical perspective. Whether or not you were captivated by the original, this new release serves as a valuable re-visit to a pivotal era in military history that changed the face of aerial combat as we knew it. There are few people on this earth better suited to tell the story than Col.

As they discover their new home, the family also discover surprising, and wonderfully funny, new things about themselves.<br></p><p>Tove Jansson was born in Helsingfors, Finland, in 1914. Her mother was a caricaturist who designed 165 of Finland&#39;s stamps and her father was a sculptor. She studied painting in Finland, Sweden and France, and subsequently became a book illustrator. Her extraordinary illustrative style is seen as a design classic the world over. Originally written in Swedish, the Moomintroll books have been translated into over 40 languages and adapted for television, film, radio and opera. Tove Jansson lived alone on a small island in the gulf of Finland, where most of her books were written. She died in 2001.<p>Chapter 1<br>The Family in the Crystal Ball<br>One afternoon at the end of August, Moominpappa was walking about in his garden feeling at a loss. He had no idea what to do with himself, because it seemed everything there was to be done had already been done or was being done by somebody else.<br>Moominpappa aimlessly puttered about in his garden, his tail dragging along the ground behind him in a melancholy way. Here, down in the Valley, the heat was scorching; everything was still and silent, and not a little dusty. It was the month when there could be great forest fires, the month for taking great care.<br>He had warned the family. Time and time again he had explained how necessary it was to be careful in August. He had described the burning valley, the roar of the flames, the white-hot tree trunks, and the fire creeping along the ground underneath the moss. Blinding columns of flame flung upward against the night sky! Waves of fire, rushing down the sides of the valley and on toward the sea ...<br>&#x201c;Sizzling, they throw themselves into the sea,&#x201d; finished Moominpappa with gloomy satisfaction. &#x201c; Everything is black; everything has been burned up. A tremendous responsibility rests on the smallest creature who can lay his paws on matches.&#x201d;<br>The family stopped what they were doing and said: &#x201c;Yes. Of course. Yes, yes.&#x201d; Then they took no more notice of him and got on with what they were doing.<br>They were always doing something. Quietly, without interruption, and with great concentration, they carried on with the hundred and one small things that made up their world. It was a world that was very private, and self-contained, and to which nothing could be added. Like a map where everything has been discovered, everywhere inhabited, and where there are no bare patches left any longer. And they said to each other: &#x201c;He always talks about forest fires in August.&#x201d;<br>Moominpappa climbed up the verandah steps. His paws got stuck in the varnish as usual, making little sucking sounds all the way up and across the floor, right up to the wicker chair. His tail got stuck, too; it felt as though someone were pulling it.<br>Moominpappa sat down and shut his eyes. &#x201c;That floor ought to be revarnished,&#x201d; he thought. &#x201c;The heat makes it like that, of course. But a good varnish shouldn&#x2019;t start melting just because it&#x2019;s hot. Perhaps I used the wrong sort of varnish. It&#x2019;s an awfully long time since I built the verandah, and it&#x2019;s high time it was revarnished. But first it&#x2019;ll have to be rubbed with sandpaper, a rotten job that no one will thank me for doing. But there&#x2019;s something special about a new white floor, painted with a thick brush and shiny varnish. The family will have to use the back door and keep out of the way while I&#x2019;m doing it. And then I&#x2019;ll let them come in, saying: &#x2018;There you are! Look, your new verandah!&#x2019; ... It&#x2019;s much too hot. I&#x2019;d love to be out sailing. Sailing right out to sea, as far as I can go ...&#x201d;<br>Moominpappa felt a sleepy feeling in his paws. He shook himself and lit his pipe. The match went on burning in the ashtray, and he watched it, fascinated. Just before it went out, he tore up some bits of newspaper and put them on the flame. It was a pretty little fire, hardly visible in the sunshine, but it was burning nicely. He watched it carefully.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s going out again,&#x201d; said Little My. &#x201c;Put some more on!&#x201d; She was sitting in the shade on the verandah railings.<br>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s you!&#x201d; said Moominpappa, and he shook the ashtray until the fire went out. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just watching the way fire burns. It&#x2019;s very important.&#x201d;<br>Little My laughed, and went on looking at him. Then he pulled his hat down over his eyes and took refuge in sleep.<br>&#x201c;Pappa,&#x201d; said Moomintroll. &#x201c;Wake up! We&#x2019;ve just put out a forest fire!&#x201d;<br>Both Moominpappa&#x2019;s paws were stuck firmly to the floor. He wrenched them loose with a strong feeling of reluctance. It wasn&#x2019;t fair. &#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;A real little forest fire,&#x201d; Moomintroll told him. &#x201c;Just behind the tobacco patch. The moss was on fire, and Mamma says that it might have been a spark from the chimney ...&#x201d;<br>Moominpappa leapt into the air and in a flash became a determined man of action. His hat rolled down the steps.<br>&#x201c;We put it out!&#x201d; Moomintroll shouted. &#x201c;We put it out right away. There&#x2019;s nothing for you to worry about!&#x201d;<br>Moominpappa stopped dead. He was feeling very angry. &#x201c;Have you put it out without me?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t anybody tell me? You just let me go on sleeping without saying anything!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But, dearest,&#x201d; said Moominmamma, leaning out of the kitchen window, &#x201c;we didn&#x2019;t think it was really necessary to wake you up. It was a very small fire, and it was only smoking a little. I happened to be going by with some buckets of water, so all I had to do was to sprinkle a few drops on it in passing ...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In passing,&#x201d; cried Moominpappa. &#x201c;Just sprinkle.<br>Sprinkle, indeed! What a word! And leaving the fire to burn under the moss unguarded! Where is it? Where is it?&#x201d;<br>Moominmamma left what she was doing and led the way to the tobacco patch. Moomintroll stayed on the verandah gazing after them. The black spot in the moss was a very small spot indeed.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t imagine,&#x201d; said Moominpappa at last, very slowly, &#x201c;that a spot like this isn&#x2019;t dangerous. Far from it. It can go on burning under the moss, you see. In the ground. Hours and perhaps even days may go by, and then suddenly, whoof! The fire breaks out somewhere quite different. Do you see what I mean?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, dearest,&#x201d; answered Moominmamma.<br>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;m going to stay here,&#x201d; Moominpappa went on, sulkily digging in the moss. &#x201c;I shall stand guard over it. I&#x2019;ll stay here all night if necessary.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do you really think ...&#x201d; Moominmamma began. Then she just said, &#x201c;Yes. That&#x2019;s very good of you. One never knows what will happen with moss.&#x201d;<br>Moominpappa sat all afternoon watching the little black spot, first pulling up the moss for quite a way round it. He wouldn&#x2019;t leave it to go indoors for his dinner. He really wanted the others to think he was offended.<br>&#x201c;Do you think he&#x2019;ll stay out there all night?&#x201d; asked Moomintroll.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s quite possible,&#x201d; said Moominmamma.<br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re sore, you&#x2019;re sore,&#x201d; observed Little My, peeling her potatoes with her teeth. &#x201c;You have to be angry sometimes. Every Little Creep has a right to be angry. But he&#x2019;s angry in the wrong way. He&#x2019;s not letting it out, just shutting it up inside him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My dear child,&#x201d; said Moominmamma, &#x201c;Pappa knows what he&#x2019;s doing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think he does,&#x201d; said Little My simply. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t know at all. Do you know?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not really,&#x201d; Moominmamma had to admit.<br>Moominpappa dug his nose in the moss and was aware of the sour smell of smoke. The ground wasn&#x2019;t even warm any longer. He emptied his pipe into the hole and blew on the sparks. They glowed for a moment or two and then went out. He stamped on the fatal spot and then walked slowly down the garden to have a look in his crystal ball.<br>Dusk was rising from the ground, as it usually did, gathering in under the trees. Round the crystal ball there was a little more light. There it stood, reflecting the whole garden, looking very beautiful on its coral pedestal. It was Moominpappa&#x2019;s very own crystal ball, his own magic ball of shining blue glass, the center of the garden, of the Valley, and of the whole world.<br>But Moominpappa didn&#x2019;t look into it right away. First he looked at his grimy paws, trying to collect all his vague, scattered, and troubled thoughts. When he was feeling as sad as he possibly could, he looked into the crystal ball for consolation. Every evening of that long, warm, beautiful, and melancholy summer he had done the same thing.<br>The crystal ball was always cool. Its blue was deeper and clearer than the blue of the sea itself, and it changed the color of the whole world, so that it became cool and remote and strange. At the center of this glass world he saw himself, his own big nose, and around him he saw the reflection of a transformed, dreamlike landscape. The blue ground was deep, deep down inside, and there where he couldn&#x2019;t reach, Moominpappa began to search for his family. He only had to wait a while and they always came. They were always reflected in the crystal ball.<br>It was only natural, because they had so much to do at dusk. They were always doing something. Sooner or later, Moominmamma would bustle over from the kitchen side of the house toward the outside cellar to fetch some sausages or some butter. Or to the potato patch. Or to get some wood. Every time she did it, she looked as though she were walking down a completely strange and exciting path. But you could never be sure. She might just as well be out on some secret errand of her own which she thought was fun, or playing some private game, or just walking round for the sake of it.<br>There she came, scampering along like a busy white ball, farthest away among the bluest of blue shadows. And there was Moomintroll, aloof and keeping himself to himself. And there was Little My, slinking up the slope more like a movement than anything else, you could see so little of her. She was just a glimpse of something determined and independent&#x2014;something so independent that it had no need to show itself. But their reflections made them all seem incredibly small, and the crystal ball made all their movements seem forlorn and aimless.<br>Moominpappa liked this. It was his evening gam...</p></p><h2>A Fine and Bitter Snow: A Kate Shugak Novel (Kate Shugak Mysteries)</h2><p>Change never comes easy, but it comes just the same, and it's on its way to the Park, to Niniltna, in southeast Alaska.

Virginia Woolf&#x2019;s book review has just been turned down by <i>The</i> <i>Times</i>. Lytton Strachey has not published anything. E. M. Forster has finished his first novel but does not like the title. Leonard Woolf is still a civil servant in Ceylon, and John Maynard Keynes is looking for a job. Together, this sparkling coterie of artists and intellectuals throw away convention and embrace the wild freedom of being young, single bohemians in London.<br><br> But the landscape shifts when Vanessa unexpectedly falls in love and her sister feels dangerously abandoned. Eerily possessive, charismatic, manipulative, and brilliant, Virginia has always lived in the shelter of Vanessa&#x2019;s constant attention and encouragement. Without it, she careens toward self-destruction and madness. As tragedy and betrayal threaten to destroy the family, Vanessa must decide if it is finally time to protect her own happiness above all else.<br><br> The work of exciting young newcomer Priya Parmar, <i>Vanessa and Her Sister</i> exquisitely captures the champagne-heady days of prewar London and the extraordinary lives of sisters Vanessa Bell and Virginia Woolf.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Vanessa and Her Sister</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Fiction and history merge seamlessly in this dazzling novel.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Being related to Virginia Woolf can&#x2019;t have been easy.

Ages 4-8.</p><p>Charles Tazewell has authored several children's stories, including <i>The Littleset Snowman's Christmas Gift</i> which won the Thomas A. Edison Prize in 1956Grade 1-3?First released in book form in 1946, this story has since appeared in numerous editions. It tells of a small angel who simply can't get with the program no matter how hard he tries until an understanding elder realizes that he is homesick and is able to retrieve a box of his most treasured possessions from "back home." When it comes time for Jesus to be born on Earth, the Littlest Angel gives his precious box to the Baby, but he is worried that God will think his gift too humble. However, God is pleased indeed, and transforms the box into the Star of Bethlehem. The writing style is rather ornate and full of grandiose words and phrases, but some children will love to hear it read aloud. The oil paintings are muted and full of texture, and not at all sentimental. The celestial choir is multicultural, and the Littlest Angel has red shorts peeking out of his robe. Paul Micich's version (Ideals, 1991) has a glossier "greeting-card" look. This reincarnation of the story will be as popular as its predecessors.?EM<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Arm in Arm: A Collection of Connections, Endless Tales, Reiterations, and Other Echolalia</h2><p>Hailed by the New York Times as a rare and original collection of "verbal and visual witticisms...as joyfully illustrated as it is absurd," ARM IN ARM has delighted children&#x2014;and grown-ups&#x2014;for years with its endless tales, gleeful riddles, circular poems, and fantastical drawings.</p><p>REMY CHARLIP is an artist, writer, dancer, teacher, theater director, choreographer, and creator of such modern classics as Fortunately, I Love You, Arm in Arm and Mother Mother I Feel Sick, Send for the Doctor, Quick, Quick, Quick.

With Gass's own background in philosophy, it seemed natural to begin with the <b>Duino Elegies</b>, the poems in which Rilke's ideas are most fully expressed and which as a group are important not only as one of the supreme poetic achievements of the West but also because of the way in which they came to be written -- in a storm of inspiration. <br><br>Gass examines the genesis of the ideas that inform the <b>Elegies</b> and discusses previous translations. He writes, as well, about Rilke the man: his character, his relationships, his life. <br>Finally, his extraordinary translation of the <b>Duino Elegies</b> offers us the experience of reading Rilke with a new and fuller understanding.</p><p>William H. Gass was born in Fargo, North Dakota, in 1924. He has been the recipient of grants from the Rockefeller and Guggenheim Foundations, as well as the Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Award for Fiction, the Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Medal of Merit for Fiction, the Lannan Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award, and the National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism (1985 and 1996). He has also won the Pushcart Prize (1976, 1983, 1987, 1992), and his work has appeared four times in <b>Best American Short Stories</b>. He lives in St. Louis, where he is the director of the International Writers' Center.From "Lifeleading"<br><br>Open-eyed, Rainer Maria Rilke died in the arms of his doctor on December 29, 1926. The leukemia which killed him had been almost reluctantly diagnosed, and had struck like a storm, after a period of gathering clouds. Ulcerous sores appeared in his mouth, pain troubled his stomach and intestines, he slept a lot when his body let him, his spirit was weighed down by depression, while physically he became as thin and fluttery as a leaf. Since, according to the gloom that naturally descended on him, Rilke's creative life was over, he undertook translations during his last months: of Valery in particular -- "Eupalinos," "The Cemetery by the Sea " -- and composed his epitaph, too, invoking the flower he so devotedly tended.<br><br>rose, o pure contradiction, desire<br>to be no one's sleep beneath so many lids.<br><br>The myth concerning the onset of his illness was, even among his myths, the most remarkable. To honor a visitor, the Egyptian beauty Nimet Eloui, Rilke gathered some roses from his garden. While doing so, he pricked his hand on a thorn. This small wound failed to heal, grew rapidly worse, soon his entire arm was swollen, and his other arm became affected as well. According to the preferred story, this was the way Rilke's disease announced itself, although Ralph Freedman, his judicious and most recent biographer, puts that melancholy event more than a year earlier.<br><br>Roses climb his life as if he were their trellis. Turn the clock back twenty-four years to 1900. Rilke is a guest at Worpswede, an artists' colony near Bremen, and it is there he has made the acquaintance of the painter Paula Becker and his future wife, Clara Westhoff. One bright Sunday morning, in a romantic mood, Rilke brings his new friends a few flowers, and writes about the gesture in his diary:<br><br>I invented a new form of caress: placing a rose gently on a closed eye until its coolness can no longer be felt; only the gentle petal will continue to rest on the eyelid like sleep just before dawn.<br><br>The poet never forgets a metaphor. Nor do his friends forget the poet's passions. Move on to 1907 now, when, in Capri, Rilke composes "The Bowl of Roses," beginning this poem with an abrupt jumble of violent images:<br><br>You've seen their anger flare, seen two boys<br>bunch themselves into a ball of animosity<br>and roll across the ground<br>like some dumb animal set upon by bees;<br>you've seen those carny barkers, mile-high liars,<br>the careening tangle of bolting horses,<br>their upturned eyes and flashing teeth,<br>as if the skull were peeled back from the mouth.<br><br>Bullyboys, actors, tellers of tall tales, runaway horses -- fright, force, and falsification -- losing composure, pretending, revealing pain and terror: these are compared to the bowl of roses. Rilke has come from Berlin, where his new publisher, Insel Verlag, has been distressed to discover that Rilke's former publisher plans to bring out <b>The Book of Hours</b> as well as a revised <b>Cornet</b>. This does not get the new alliance off to a smooth and trusting start. Moreover, Rilke is broke again. During 1906, the poet had been bankrolled by his friend Karl von der Heydt, who twice generously deposited funds in Rilke's Paris bank, but Rilke's habit of staying in deluxe hotels and eating (modestly) in expensive restaurants, his dependence upon porters and maids and trains, had left him holding nothing more than his ticket to Alice Faehndrich's Villa Discopoli on Capri. Von der Heydt sent him some supplementary funds eventually, but not before making a face. Perhaps these unpleasantries account for the poem's oddly violent and discordant opening.<br><br>But now you know how to forget such things,<br>for now before you stands the bowl of roses,<br>unforgettable and wholly filled<br>with unattainable being and promise,<br>a gift beyond anyone's giving, a presence<br>that might be ours and our perfection.<br><br>More than a bowl was set before him. Though the New Year was approaching, the island was abloom with winter roses, and Rilke's cottage, on the grounds of the villa, was covered with them.<br><br>Living in silence, endlessly unfolding,<br>using space without space being taken<br>from a space even trinkets diminish;<br>scarcely the hint there of outline or ground<br>they are so utterly in, so strangely delicate<br>and self-lit--to the very edge:<br>is it possible we know anything like this?<br>And then like this: that a feeling arises<br>because now and then the petals kiss?<br>And this: that one should open like an eye,<br>to show more lids beneath, each closed<br>in a sleep as deep as ten, to quench<br>an inner fire of visionary power.<br>And this above all: that through these petals<br>light must make its way. Out of one thousand skies<br>they slowly drain each drop of darkness<br>so that this concentrated glow<br>will bestir the stamens till they stand.<br><br>The rose is a distilling eye. It gathers light and filters it until the concentration is powerful and pure, until its stamens become erect. If the rose is not a poem, the poem is surely a rose.<br><br>And the movement in the roses, look:<br>gestures which make such minute vibrations<br>they'd remain invisible if their rays<br>did not resolutely ripple out into the wide world.<br>Look at that white one which has blissfully unfolded<br>to stand amidst its splay of petals<br>like Venus boldly balanced on her shell;<br>look too at the bloom that blushes, bends<br>toward the one with more composure,<br>and see how the pale one aloofly withdraws;<br>and how the cold one stands, closed upon itself,<br>among those open roses, shedding all.<br>And what they shed: how it can be light or heavy,<br>a cloak, a burden, a wing, a mask -- it just depends --<br>and how they let it fall: as if disrobing for a lover.<br>E. M. Butler, whose Rilke of 1941 was the first biography of the poet to appear in English, writes:<br><br>"There is no doubt that roses cast a spell upon Rilke. Monique Saint-Helier recounts how he once sent her some fading flowers to die with her [<i>sic</i> -- Butler means "to die in her company"], because he was going away. His description of a vase of falling roses in Late Poems represents him as keeping them in his room until they were really dead, when he embalmed their petals in books and used them for pot-pourri. Rilke's roses were always explicitly in enclosed spaces: in death-bed chambers, in his study at night, in rose-bowls, bringing summer into a room, bestrewing the chimney-piece as they shed their petals. And even in his garden at Muzot, they seemed to be clad in pink silk boudoir-gowns and red summer dresses, like carefully tended and cherished, fragrant and fragile hothouse blooms."<br><br>The poet collects the world inside himself as the rose gathers the light of the skies, and there he intensifies it until the phallic element of the flower dominates the symbol. Eventually the rose bestrews itself. Petals, like poems, leave their tree. The beautiful unity the rose once was now becomes a fall of discoloring shards; yet these petals can help us see to another part of the world as through a stained-glass window.<br><br>What can't they be? Was that yellow one,<br>lying there hollow and open, not the rind<br>of a fruit in which the very same yellow<br>was its more intense and darkening juice?<br>And was this other undone by its opening,<br>since, so exposed, its ineffable pink<br>has picked up lilac's bitter aftertaste?<br>And the cambric, is it not a dress<br>to which a chemise, light and warm as breath,<br>still clings, though both were abandoned<br>amid morning shadows near the old woodland pool?<br>And this of opalescent porcelain<br>is a shallow fragile china cup<br>full of tiny shining butterflies --<br>and there -- that one's holding nothing but itself.<br><br>Later, in the August of an emptied Paris, Rilke will compose a poem about the interior of the rose: it is first an Inside awaiting its Outside, then a bandaged wound, at last a lake full of the sky's reflection. When the rose is blown and the petals part, they fill, as if fueling for the journey, with inner space, finally overflowing into the August days, until summer becomes ein Zimmer in einem Traum -- a room in a dream. But it is "The Bowl of Roses" which remains Rilke's great rose-poem.<br><br>And aren't they all that way? just self-containing,<br>if self-containing means: to transform the world<br>with its wind and rain and springtime's patience<br>and guilt and restlessness and obscure fate<br>and the darkness of evening earth and even<br>the changing clouds, coming and going,<br>even the vague intercession of distant stars,<br>into a handful of inner life.<br>It now lies free of care in these open roses.<br><br>It would be tempting to organize Rilke's biography around such themes, because the themes are there: the significance of the rose, the mirror, the unicorn, the puppet, the fountain, or the pathos (as for Poe) of the death of a young woman; his increasing "belief" in animism (that all things, as well as the parts of all things, are filled with life); the notion that we grow our death inside us like a talent or a tumor; that we are here to realize the world, to raise it, like Lazarus, from its sullen numbness into consciousness; that differences are never absolute, but that everything (life and death, for instance) lies on a continuum, as colors do; that we are strangers in a world of strangers; that simple people have a deeper understanding of their existence than most, and an insight into the secret rhythms of nature. These themes are like tides that rise and fall inside him, as if he were just their bay and receptive shoreline.<br><br>Rilke's parents had lost a daughter the year before they begot Rene (as he was christened); hoping for another daughter to replace her, and until he was ready to enter school, his mother, Phia, got him up girlishly, combed his curls, encouraged him to call his good self Sophie, and handled him like a china doll, cooing and cuddling him until such time as he was abruptly put away in a drawer.

He asks them to make a list of the people who have hurt or deceived them over the years, posing the question: <i>Would your world be a better place if these people ceased to exist?</i> Treating the exercise as a game, Regan plays along. After ten minutes, Shields instructs the participants to bring their sheets of paper to the fireplace and throw them into the flames.

Now brutal murders seem to stalk her every move&#x2013;and a growing attraction to Alec may compromise her safety, while stirring up tender emotions she thought she could no longer feel. Yet as the danger intensifies and a serial killer circles ever closer, Regan must discover who has turned her private revenge fantasies into grisly reality.</p><p><b>JULIE GARWOOD</b> is the author of many <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <i>Killjoy</i>, <i>Mercy</i>, <i>Heartbreaker</i>, <i>Ransom</i>, and <i>Come the Spring</i>.

The beast always began to stir at the end of the day when his mind wasn&#x2019;t consumed with his job, and his body so desperately needed to relax.<br><br>For a long time, nearly a full year, the demon had hidden from him, and he hadn&#x2019;t known it was there. And so he&#x2019;d naively believed that he was having panic attacks, or spells, as he liked to think of them, because that somehow made them less threatening. They started with a yearning deep in his belly. It wasn&#x2019;t altogether unpleasant. He likened the sensation to wrapping his arms around a hot stone to warm his freezing body, but as the day progressed, the stone began to get hotter and hotter, until it radiated unbearable heat. Anxiety would come over him then, horrific anxiety that would make his skin crawl and his lungs burn with the need to scream and scream and scream, and in desperation he would think about taking one of his special pills the doctor had prescribed, but he never did take anything, not even an aspirin, for fear the medication would weaken him.<br><br>He believed he was a good man. He paid his taxes, went to church on Sundays, and held down a full-time job. It was a stressful, had-to-stay-on-his-toes kind of job, requiring his full concentration, and there wasn&#x2019;t time to think or worry about the heavy burden waiting for him at home. He didn&#x2019;t mind the long hours. In fact, there were times he was grateful for them. He never ran from his responsibilities in his professional or his personal life. He took care of his invalid wife, Nina. At her insistence they had moved to Chicago for a new start after the accident. He&#x2019;d found employment within two weeks of his arrival and had felt that was a good omen. It was a hectic but joyful time. He and Nina decided to use a small portion of the settlement money to purchase a spacious story-and-a-half house on the outskirts of the city, and once they were unpacked, he spent the summer evenings putting in ramps and modifying the first floor so that Nina wouldn&#x2019;t have any trouble getting around in her new state-of-the-art, featherweight wheelchair. Nina&#x2019;s legs had been mangled in the accident, and she would, of course, never walk again. He accepted what fate had dealt them and moved forward. He was relieved when his wife slowly regained her strength and learned to do for herself during the day.<br><br>When he was home, he insisted on pampering her. He prepared their dinner every night and did the dishes, then spent the rest of the evening with her watching their favorite television shows.<br><br>They&#x2019;d been married ten years, and in all that time their love hadn&#x2019;t diminished. If anything, the terrible accident had removed any possibility of their falling into complacency or taking each other for granted. And no wonder. His sweet, gentle Nina had died on that operating table, and then, miracle of miracles, had come back to him. The surgeons had worked through the night to save her. When he heard the news that she would recover, he got down on his knees in the hospital chapel and vowed to spend the rest of his life making her happy.<br><br>He lived a rich, full life . . . with one little exception.<br><br>Awareness of the demon hadn&#x2019;t been gradual. No, enlightenment had come all at once.<br><br>It was the middle of the night. He hadn&#x2019;t been able to sleep, and rather than toss and turn and possibly wake Nina, he went to the kitchen on the opposite end of the house and paced about. He thought a glass of warm milk might help calm his jitters and make him sleepy, but it really didn&#x2019;t do much good. He was putting the empty glass in the sink when it slipped out of his hand and shattered in the basin. The sound seemed to reverberate throughout the house. He rushed to the bedroom door and stood outside, waiting and listening. The noise hadn&#x2019;t awakened his wife, and he felt a moment of relief as he padded back to the kitchen.<br><br>His anxiety was building. Was he losing his mind? No, no. He was having one of his spells. That was all. And this one wasn&#x2019;t so terrible. He could handle it.<br><br>The newspaper was on the counter where he&#x2019;d left it. He picked it up and carried it to the table. He decided he would read every single page, or until he was so sleepy he couldn&#x2019;t keep his eyes open.<br><br>He started with the sports section, read every word, and then moved on to the metropolitan news. He scanned an article about the dedication of a new park and jogging path, spread the paper wide and immediately saw the photo of a beautiful young woman standing in front of a group of men. She was posed with scissors ready to cut a ribbon draped from one stake to another across the path. And she was smiling at him.<br><br>He couldn&#x2019;t take his eyes off her.<br><br>He was reading the names under the photo when it happened. He suddenly felt a crushing tightness, and he couldn&#x2019;t catch his breath. A jolt very much like lightning raced through his heart causing excruciating pain. Was he having a heart attack, or was it another panic attack?<br><br>Try to calm down, he told himself. Just calm down. Take deep breaths.<br><br>The anxiety was growing even stronger, and with it came the horrific yet familiar terror. Then his skin began to burn and itch, and he frantically scratched his arms and legs as he jumped up and paced around the kitchen island. What was happening to him?<br><br>He realized he was running and forced himself to stop. Looking down, he saw the long, jagged scratches. There were bloody streaks on his arms and legs, some cuts so deep, blood dripped on the floor. He was close to exploding. He tore at his hair and whimpered, but the terror was taunting him now. Then, like a blinding light, the epiphany came. He suddenly realized he no longer had control over his own body. He couldn&#x2019;t even make himself breathe.<br><br>With startling clarity he saw and understood. Someone else was breathing for him.<br><br>He awakened the following morning curled up in the fetal position on the kitchen floor. Had he fainted? He thought maybe he had. He staggered to his feet and braced his hands on the island to steady himself. Closing his eyes, he took several deep breaths and slowly straightened. He spotted the scissors on top of the folded newspaper. Had he placed them there? He couldn&#x2019;t remember. He put the scissors back in the drawer where they belonged and picked up the newspaper to throw it into the recycle bin in the garage. He saw the clipping from the newspaper then. Both the article and the photo of the smiling woman were there in the center of his table, waiting for him. He knew who had placed them there. And he knew why.<br><br>The demon wanted her.<br><br>He buried his face in his hands and wept.<br><br>He knew that he must find another way to placate the beast. Physical activity seemed to help. He went to the gym and began to work out like a man obsessed. One of his favorite routines was to put on boxing gloves and pound the bag as hard as he could for as long as he could. He would lose track of time and stop only when he couldn&#x2019;t raise his arms without suffering unbearable pain.<br><br>For days he&#x2019;d kept his body in the state of perpetual exhaustion. Then, even that wasn&#x2019;t enough.<br><br>Time was running out. The demon was consuming him. Ironically, it was his wife who gave him the idea. One evening, while she kept him company as he did the dishes, she suggested that he should have a night out. A night, she insisted, when he could enjoy himself and have some fun with his friends.<br><br>He put up quite an argument. There were already too many nights when he had to be away from her because of pressing commitments at work. And what about all the time he left to go running or to work out at the gym? Surely that was enough alone time.<br><br>She was more stubborn than he was and wouldn&#x2019;t stop cajoling. He finally agreed, only to make her happy.<br><br>And so, tonight would be his first night out. He could already feel the adrenaline pumping. He was as nervous and excited as he had been when he had gone on his first date.<br><br>Before leaving home, he told Nina he would be heading into the city after work to meet some friends at Sully&#x2019;s, a popular bar and grill, but she wasn&#x2019;t to worry; if he had more than one drink, he wouldn&#x2019;t drive home. He&#x2019;d take a cab.<br><br>All of it was a lie.<br><br>No, he wasn&#x2019;t going to the city to relax. He was going there to hunt.<br><br> Chapter Two REGAN MADISON HAD SPENT THREE MISERABLE DAYS AND NIGHTS surrounded by sleazebags. They seemed to be everywhere&#x2014;in the airports, at the hotel, and on the streets of Rome as well. A sleazebag, as she defined him, was a lecherous but rich old man with a mistress less than half his age hanging on his arm. Regan had never really paid any attention to such couples be- fore her stepfather, Emerson, married Cindy, his child bride. Regan understood the appeal. Cindy had the body of a strip- per.

In their latest outing, Kincaid and his former partner--and soon-to-be roommate--follow a twisting trail of rage and retribution whose buried roots are about to exact a deadly toll on the living.<br><br><b>And Justice There is None<br><br></b>Gemma James is adjusting to professional and personal changes that include her eagerly sought promotion to the rank of inspector--and a future now intricately entwined with Duncan Kincaid. But her new responsibilities are put to the test when she is placed in charge of a particularly brutal homicide: The lovely young wife of a wealthy antiques dealer has been found murdered on fashionable Notting Hill.<br><br>Dawn Arrowood was six weeks pregnant. Her lover, Alex Dunn, a porcelain dealer in London&#x2019;s bustling Portobello Market, appears absolutely devastated by her death, but Gemma&#x2019;s the main focus of investigation is soon Karl Arrowood, who had the most powerful motive for killing his unfaithful wife. But this case sets off warning bells for Duncan: it&#x2019;s far too similar to an unsolved murder in which an antiques dealer was killed in precisely the same way and when the escalating violence claims yet another victim, he and Gemma find themselves at increasing odds with each other--as two separate investigations become linked in the most startling of ways. Their hunt for a killer will traverse the teeming stalls of the city&#x2019;s antiques markets to a decades-in-the-making vendetta of history and hatred that has been honed to a flawless, deadly point. To solve this case, Gemma and Duncan must walk a merciless razor&#x2019;s edge through a place where true justice will be a long time coming.</p><p>The life of Scotland Yard's Gemma James is changing in major ways--she's just been promoted to Inspector, she's pregnant, and she and her young son are about to move into spacious new digs with her lover, Detective Superintendent Duncan Kincaid. Then the beautiful young wife of a Portobello Road antiques dealer is murdered in the driveway of her Notting Hill home and the case lands in Gemma's disappearing lap. Dawn Arrowood, as Gemma soon discovers, was pregnant when she died, most likely by Alex Dunn, a porcelain dealer in Portobello Market whose disappearance after the murder makes him a prime suspect. But Gemma rules him out as the killer, focusing her investigation on Karl Arrowood, the dead woman's husband. When Karl is murdered, she's stymied, but then Kincaid's investigation into what may be a serial killer turns up a bizarre connection to Gemma's case and a link to Karl Arrowood's sideline as a drug smuggler. As usual, Crombie handles a complicated plot with style, providing enough twists and turns to hold the reader's attention while driving the narrative to a stunning conclusion. <i>--Jane Adams</i><b>Praise for the Acclaimed Novels of Deborah Crombie<br><br>A Finer End<br><br></b>&#x201c;Crombie has laid claim to the literary territory of moody psychological suspense owned by P.

Freelance music writer Azzerad profiles 13 innovative bands, focusing on those on the SST, Dischord, Touch &amp; Go, and Sub Pop record labels. Each chapter is devoted to a particular band, such as Black Flag, Hnsker Dn, the Butthole Surfers, Fugazi, and the Minutemen. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>Michael Azerrad is a music journalist who has written for a number of magazines, including Rolling Stone, Spin, and Billboard. He is the author of <i>Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana</i>, and <i>Screaming Life: A Chronicle of the Seattle Music Scene</i>. He lives in New York City.Nirvana's mega-bestselling Nevermind was credited with dramatically altering the American pop-musical landscape. Azerrad ably demonstrates that the "new" sound actually sprang from almost 15 years of innovation by hundreds of bands who remained "[b]elow the radar of the corporate behemoths." Linked under the loose rubric "indie rock," bands like Black Flag, Sonic Youth, Minor Threat and the Replacements languished in the musical minor leagues because they were too experimental for commercial radio, made unfortunate career decisions or eschewed mainstream success. Yet these bands formed the nucleus of a new youth movement. Youths who defined themselves in opposition to middle-American values found an aesthetic and a community through the music. Given the fervor for indie progeny like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, the indie scene's impact was not insignificant and rock journalist Azerrad (Come as You Are) partly aims to trace that larger cultural legacy. But this thick slice of nostalgia, replete with colorful anecdotes that demystify even deliberately mystifying artists, primarily targets die-hard supporters of seminal 1980s indie bands, underground-club scenesters and 1980s college radio buffs. Though day-in-the-life bios predominate over extensive musical or cultural analysis, this is an astute insider's account of the collective accomplishment of these various bands: strong musical and political statements by people with little clout and even less financial support that reverberated throughout youth culture. A devotee himself, Azerrad is occasionally belligerent in his support of his subjects' art and attitudes, but he also deftly captures the thrill of being young, antiestablishment and impassioned the inspiring ingredients of all these bands.

Leaving revue behind her, Gertie opens in a straight play, <i>Candle Light. </i>No�l sends her one of what would be a string of teasing cables:<br><br>&#x201c;LEGITIMATE AT LAST WON&#x2019;T MOTHER BE PLEASED?&#x201d;<br><br>Then, that same year, on a tour of the Far East, No�l found himself waiting in the Imperial Hotel, Tokyo, for his friend and traveling companion, Jeffrey Amherst. On the night before Jeffrey was due to arrive, No�l went to bed early, but as soon as he had turned off the light, the idea for <i>Private Lives </i>came to him. By the turn of the year he was in Shanghai and, when a bout of fever confined him to bed at the Cathay Hotel, he used the time to actually <i>write </i>the play.<br><br>That turned out to be the easy part. The hard part was pinning down Gertie&#x2019;s butterfly mind. No�l cabled her immediately he put his pen down:<br><br>&#x201c;HAVE WRITTEN DELIGHTFUL NEW COMEDY STOP GOOD PART FOR YOU STOP WONDERFUL ONE FOR ME STOP KEEP YOURSELF FREE FOR AUTUMN PRODUCTION.&#x201d;<br><br>He then sent her a copy and she replied:<br><br>&#x201c;HAVE READ NEW PLAY STOP NOTHING WRONG THAT CAN&#x2019;T BE FIXED STOP GERTIE&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;THE ONLY THING THAT WILL NEED TO BE FIXED IS YOUR PERFORMANCE STOP NOEL&#x201d;<br><br>There then followed an avalanche of cables in which confusion soon became worse confounded. She&#x2019;d committed herself to Andr� Charlot for a new revue. Could they open in the following January instead of this September? Why didn&#x2019;t No�l appear in the revue with her to fill in the time? Why didn&#x2019;t No�l cable and ask Charlot to release her from the contract? Well, actually it wasn&#x2019;t so much of a <i>contract </i>as a moral obligation . . . Come to think of it, it probably <i>was </i>a contract of a sort and her lawyers were trying to get her out of it . . . She&#x2019;d rather do <i>Private Lives </i>than anything. . . No, she couldn&#x2019;t do it at all . . . <br><br>No�l had finally had enough. When&#x2013;forty pounds&#x2019; worth of telegrams later&#x2013;she finally remembered to give him her cable address, he wired her that he now planned to do the play with someone else anyway. He heard nothing more until he arrived back in England in May, by which time Gertie&#x2019;s lawyer, the redoubtable Fanny Holtzmann, had pried her free of the Charlot contract.<br><br>&#x201c;La Capponcina<br>Cap d&#x2019;Ail<br>Alpes Maritimes<br>Thursday or Friday?<br><br>Darling!<br><br>Am I wrong or did I hear you mention something about a play we were going to do in London first then in America after?<br><br>Please let me know, because at present me &#x2019;ouse is full as a pig&#x2013; and I would like to do something about putting up with you&#x2013;sorry&#x2013;I mean&#x2013;well, you know&#x2013;should you wish to visit me here to discuss ways and means.<br><br>Love Gert&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dear Miss Lawrence,<br>With regard to your illiterate scrawl of 14th inst., Mr. Coward asks me to say that there was talk of you playing a small part in a play of his on condition that you tour and find your own clothes (same to be of reasonable quality) and understudy Jessie Matthews whom you have always imitated. [In fact, it was Matthews who had understudied and carbon-copied Gertie in the New York production of the 1924 <i>Charlot Revue.</i>] Mr. Coward will be visiting some rather important people in the South of France in mid-July and he will appear at Cap d&#x2019;Ail [the location of Edward Molyneux&#x2019;s house, which Gertie was renting], whether you like it or not, with Mr. Wilson, on the 20th. If by chance there is no room in the rather squalid lodgings you have taken, would you be so kind as to engage several suites for Mr. W [Jack Wilson] and Mr. C [No�l] at the Hotel Mont Fleury, which will enable same Mr. W and Mr. C. to have every conceivable meal with you and use all your toilets for their own advantage. Several complicated contracts are being sent to you by Mr. C. on the terms you agreed upon&#x2013;i.e., �6.10s. a week and understudy.&#x201d;<br><br>With <i>Private Lives, </i>&#x201c;No�l and Gertie&#x201d; were to become a single entity in the public mind, creating an impression that&#x2013;like the Lunts&#x2013;they invariably acted together. In point of fact, they co-starred in only three original productions, of which <i>Private Lives </i>was the second and the one that defined the partnership.<br><br>Elyot Chase and Amanda Prynne are a divorced couple who meet up at the same hotel in Deauville while each is on honeymoon with a second spouse, only to discover that they are fated to be together, no matter the emotional cost to themselves or the people around them. The fictional relationship in many respects mirrored the real-life relationship between No�l and Gertie, two people deeply fond of each other but constantly bickering and testing the limits of that friendship in the certain knowledge that it is unbreakable.<br><br>No�l was both challenged and frustrated by Gertie&#x2019;s mercurial nature, quite opposite but somehow complementary to his own more ordered approach.<br><br>&#x201c;On stage,&#x201d; he wrote a few years later, &#x201c;she is potentially capable of anything and everything.

Rising above the physical and human squalor around him, his detachment and wry humour enable him to survive dereliction and destitution with dignity. &#39;&#34;Suttree&#34; contains a humour that is Faulknerian in its gentle wryness, and a freakish imaginative flair reminiscent of Flannery O&#39;Connor&#39; - &#34;Times Literary Supplement&#34;. &#39;&#34;Suttree&#34; marks McCarthy&#39;s closest approach to autobiography and is probably the funniest and most unbearably sad of his books&#39; - &#34;Stanley Booth&#34;.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Suttree</i> contains a humour that is Faulknerian in its gentle wryness, and a freakish imaginative flair reminiscent of Flannery O'Connor.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Times Literary Supplement</i> (London)<br><br>&#x201c;All of McCarthy&#x2019;s books present the reviewer with the same welcome difficulty. They are so good that one can hardly say how good they really are. . . . <i>Suttree</i> may be his magnum opus. Its protagonist, Cornelius Suttree, has forsaken his prominent family to live in a dilapidated houseboat among the inhabitants of the demimonde along the banks of the Tennessee River. His associates are mostly criminals of one sort or another, and Suttree is, to say the least, estranged from what might be called normal society. But he is so involved with life (and it with him) that when in the end he takes his leave, the reader&#x2019;s heart goes with him. <i>Suttree</i> is probably the funniest and most unbearably sad of McCarthy&#x2019;s books . . . which seem to me unsurpassed in American literature.&#x201d; &#x2014;Stanley Booth<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>By the author of Blood Meridian and All the Pretty Horses, Suttree is the story of Cornelius Suttree, who has forsaken a life of privilege with his prominent family to live in a dilapidated houseboat on the Tennessee River near Knoxville.

In clear, no-nonsense terms, Woods explains what led up to this economic crisis, who's really to blame, and why government bailouts won't work. Woods will reveal:<br>* Which brave few economists predicted the economic fallout--and why nobody listened<br>* What really caused the collapse<br>* Why the Fed--not taxpayers--should have to answer for the current economic crisis<br>* Why bailouts are band-aids that will only provide temporary relief and ultimately make things worse<br>* What we should do instead, to put our economy on a healthy path to recovery<br><br>With a foreword from Ron Paul, Meltdown is the free-market answer to the Fed-created economic crisis. As the new Obama administration inevitably calls for more regulations, Woods argues that the only way to rebuild our economy is by returning to the fundamentals of capitalism and letting the free market work</p><p>Is Capitalism the Culprit?<p>The media tells us that "deregulation" and "unfettered free markets" have wrecked our economy and will continue to make things worse without a heavy dose of federal regulation. But the real blame lies elsewhere. In <i>Meltdown</i>, bestselling author Thomas E. Woods Jr. unearths the real causes behind the collapse of housing values and the stock market--and it turns out the culprits reside more in Washington than on Wall Street.</p>And the trillions of dollars in federal bailouts? Our politicians' ham-handed attempts to fix the problems they themselves created will only make things much worse.<p>Woods, a senior fellow at the Ludwig von Mises Institute and winner of the 2006 Templeton Enterprise Award, busts the media myths and government spin. He explains how government intervention in the economy--from the Democratic hobby horse called Fannie Mae to affirmative action programs like the Community Redevelopment Act--actually caused the housing bubble.</p><p>Most important, Woods, author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History</i>, traces this most recent boom-and-bust--and all such booms and busts of the past century--back to one of the most revered government institutions of all: the Federal Reserve System, which allows busy-body bureaucrats and ambitious politicians to pull the strings of our financial sector and manipulate the value of the very money we use.</p><i>Meltdown</i> also provides a timely history lesson to counter the current clamor for a <i>new</i> New Deal. The Great Depression, Woods demonstrates, was only as deep and as long as it was because of the government interventions by Herbert Hoover (no free-market capitalist, despite what your high school history teacher may have taught you) and Franklin D. Roosevelt (no savior of the American economy, in spite of what the mainstream media says). If you want to understand what caused the financial meltdown--and why none of the big-government solutions being tried today will work--<i>Meltdown</i> explains it all.From the Foreword by Congressman Ron Paul<p>We can probably expect an avalanche of books in the coming months that purport to tell us what happened to the economy and what we should do about it. They'll be dead wrong, and most of the advice they provide will be dreadful. You can count on that. That's why <i>Meltdown</i> is so important. This book actually gets things right. It correctly identifies our problems, their causes, and what we should do about them. It treats the architects of this debacle not with the undeserved reverence they receive in Washington and on television, but with the critical eye that is so conspicuously missing from our supposedly independent thinkers in academia and the media. Tom Woods reserves his admiration for those few who, unlike the quacks who would instruct us now, actually saw the crisis coming, have a theory to explain it, and can show us the way out. In a short span, Tom Woods introduces the layman to a range of subjects that have been excluded from our national discussion for much too long. Topics our opinion leaders thought they'd buried forever, or never heard of in the first place, are suddenly back, and not a moment too soon. This book is an indispensable conduit of these critical ideas. . . . Ideas still matter, and sound economic education has rarely been as urgently necessary as it is today. There is no better book to read on the present crisis than this one, and that is why I am delighted to endorse and introduce it.</p></p><h2>Flora Photographica: Masterpieces of Flower Photography : 1835 to the Present</h2><p>A celebration of more than 180 hand-painted tintypes, daguerreotypes, platinum, silver, gum prints, and high-saturation modern color photographs of flowers reveals the work of Eugene Atget, Ansel Adams, and others</p><p>For the photography aficionado and the true lover of forms, this retrospective is testimony to the medium's ability to capture radiant energy. The author deftly scans the various stations held by the flower throughout its captured life on film. From its starring role as solitary subject to its ancillary position as accent or accoutrement, the flower has been an irrefutable part of artistic expression. Indeed, cubism, constructivism, dadaism, and surrealism have a place in the pages of this historical account. Photographic greats including Edward Steichen, Imogen Cunningham, Mark Anthony, and Edward Weston grace the pages of this volume, and various treatments of floral symbolism are considered. Words such as purity and innocence, formality and flamboyance are used in the introduction to describe how the flower has been interpreted throughout the decades. To turn from page to page is to be invited inside the creations and imagination of artisans whose work will live on.

It contains more than six hundred volumes of Tibetan manuscripts, ranging in date from the late 11th to the early 16th century. This library in many ways constitutes a cultural history of Dolpo in this period thanks to some sixty volumes with historical prefaces explaining the commission of the manuscripts for the Nesar Temple, while more than one hundred other volumes have illuminations of the scenes of the life of the Buddha and episodes from the Praj� p ramit (Perfection of Wisdom) texts. These illuminations inform us about the donors, their costumes, their Buddhist rituals while the dedications tell us about the systems of patronage and donation. Some illuminations reflect the ancient manuscripts of Tabo and Tholing, others reflect the sophisticated Newar aesthetic of Kathmandu and all these diverse tendencies reached Dolpo where they were appreciated. By studying these texts within and examining the styles of the manuscript illuminations, Amy Heller was able to shed light on the history of this remote Tibetan enclave, the spread of Buddhism in the Himalayas and its artistic legacy. The manuscripts, sculptures and mural paintings discovered in Dolpo are the concrete expression of the complex economic, political, artistic and religious interactions between the people of Dolpo and their neighbors in India, Nepal and Tibet. In addition to the illuminations selected for publication, the reader will find a complimentary DVD that includes photographs of all volumes with dedications and other illuminations and historical documents preciously conserved in the Bicher village. A combination of Amy Heller s fine contributions, beautifully illustrated photographs, and a useful and accessible DVD makes this volume an important addition to the library of every scholar, collector and academic institution with an interest in Himalayan studies.</p><p></p><h2>Barbarians to Bureaucrats</h2><p>Identifies the many roles within companies that are taken up by workers--including &#34;barbarians,&#34; &#34;Builder,&#34; &#34;Prophet,&#34; and &#34;Synergist&#34;--and shows the qualities needed to perform in these roles that can strengthen corporate growth</p><p>Management consultant Miller argues that there are seven archetypal management styles, directly linked to the stages of an organization's development. A company is formed by a "prophet," whose vision is actually implemented by a efficient "barbarian." A sign of the company's decline is the hindering presence of a "bureaucrat" or "aristocrat." The innovative twist to Miller's thesis is his "synergist" archetype, the manager who is able to balance these archetypal traits to assure vitality and growth. While all of this is quite interesting, one gets the impression that Miller sees organizational culture as more malleable and dynamic than it historically has been shown to be. Terence E. Deal and Allan A. Kennedy's Corporate Cultures ( LJ 7/82) still remains the most insightful, recently published work on this topic.<br><i>- Gene R.

A pile of dorm uniforms rustled, as if a small animal stirred underneath. Then a shape slipped from among the folds of spider silk and cotton. It rose into the air and floated toward Aya's bed. Tiny lenses gazed at her face, curious and alert, reflecting starlight from the open window.</p><p>Aya grinned. "Ready to go to work?"</p><p>In answer, Moggle flashed its night-lights.</p><p>"Ouch!" Aya squeezed her eyes shut. "Don't do that! It's vision-wrecking!"</p><p>She lay in bed another moment, waiting for the spots to fade. The hovercam nuzzled against her shoulder apologetically.</p><p>"It's okay, Moggle-chan," she whispered. "I just wish I had infrared too."</p><p>Lots of people her age had infrared vision, but Aya's parents had this thing about surge. They liked to pretend the world was still stuck in the Prettytime, when everyone had to wait until they turned sixteen to change themselves. Crumblies could be so fashion-missing.</p><p>So Aya was stuck with her big nose -- definitely ugly -- and her normal vision. When she'd moved out of her home and into a dorm, her parents had given her permission to get an eyescreen and skintenna, but that was only so they could ping whenever they wanted. Still, it was better than nothing. She flexed her finger and the city interface flickered to life, layering across her vision.</p><p>"Uh-oh," she said to Moggle. "Almost midnight."</p><p>She didn't remember dozing off, but the tech-head bash must have already started. It was probably crowded by now, packed enough with surge-monkeys and manga-heads that nobody would notice one ugly extra snooping around.</p><p>Besides, Aya Fuse was an expert at being invisible. Her face rank was proof of that. It sat unmoving in the corner of her vision: 451,396.</p><p>She let out a slow sigh. In a city of a million, that was total extra-land. She'd had her own feed for almost two years now, had kicked a great story just a week ago, and was still anonymous.</p><p>Well, tonight was finally going to change that. </p><p>"Let's go, Moggle," she whispered, and slipped out of bed.</p><p>A gray robe lay in a shapeless puddle at her feet. Aya pulled it over her dorm uniform and tied it at the waist, then perched on the windowsill. She turned to face the night sky slowly, easing one leg, then the other, out into the cool air.</p><p>She slipped on her crash bracelets, glancing at the ground fifty meters below. </p><p>"Okay, that's dizzy-making."</p><p>At least no monitors were skulking around down there. That was the kick thing about a thirteenth-story room -- no one expected you to sneak out your window.</p><p>Thick clouds hung low in the sky, reflecting worklights from the construction site across town. The cold tasted of pine needles and rain, and Aya wondered if she was going to freeze in her disguise. But she couldn't exactly throw a dorm jacket over the robe and expect people not to notice.</p><p>"Hope you're all charged up, Moggle. It's drop-time."</p><p>The hovercam drifted past her shoulder and out the window, settling close against her chest. It was the size of half a soccer ball, sheathed in hard plastic and warm to the touch. As Aya wrapped her arms around Moggle, she felt her bracelets trembling, caught in the magnetic currents of the hovercam's lifters.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut. "Ready?"</p><p>Moggle shivered in her arms.</p><p>Clinging to the hovercam with all her strength, Aya pushed herself into the void.<br></p><p>Getting out was much simpler these days.</p><p>For Aya's fifteenth birthday, Ren Machino -- her big brother's best friend -- had modified Moggle. She'd only asked him to make it quick enough to keep up with her hoverboard. But like most tech-heads, Ren took pride in his mods. The new Moggle was waterproof, shockproof, and powerful enough to carry an Aya-size passenger through the air.</p><p>Close enough, anyway. With her arms wrapped around the hovercam, she fell no faster than a cherry blossom twirling toward the ground. It was much easier than stealing a bungee jacket. And except for the nervous-making moment of jumping, it was kind of fun.</p><p>She watched the windows flicker past -- dreary rooms full of standard-requisition squalor. No one famous lived in Akira Hall, just loads of face-missing extras wearing generic designs. A few ego-kickers sat talking into their cams, watched by no one. The average face rank here was six hundred thousand, despair-making and pathetic.</p><p>Obscurity in all its horror.</p><p>Back in the Prettytime, Aya vaguely remembered, you just asked for awesome clothes or a new hoverboard and they popped out of the hole in the wall like magic. But these days, the hole wouldn't give you anything decent unless you were famous or had merits to spend. And getting merits meant taking classes or doing chores -- whatever the Good Citizen Committee commanded, basically.</p><p>Moggle's lifters connected with the metal grid beneath the ground, and Aya bent her knees, rolling as she hit. The wet grass squished beneath her like a sodden sponge, soft but shivery cold.</p><p>She let go of Moggle and lay for a moment on the rain-soaked earth, letting her heartbeat slow down. "You okay?"</p><p>Moggle flashed its night-lights again.</p><p>"Okay...that's still blind-making."</p><p>Ren had also modified the hovercam's brain. True AI might still be illegal, but the new Moggle was more than just a wedge of circuitry and lifters. Since Ren's tinkering, it had learned Aya's favorite angles, when to pan and zoom, and even how to track her eyes for cues.</p><p>But for some reason, it didn't get the whole night-vision thing.</p><p>She kept her eyes closed, listening hard as she watched the spots across her vision fade. No footsteps, no whir of monitor drones. Nothing but the muffled thump of music from the dorm.</p><p>Aya rose to her feet and brushed herself off. Not that anyone would notice the wet grass clinging to her; Reputation Bombers dressed to disappear. The robe was hooded and shapeless, the perfect disguise for party-crashing.</p><p>With a twist of a crash bracelet, a hoverboard rose from its hiding place in the bushes. Stepping on, Aya faced the glittering lights of Prettyville.</p><p>Funny how everyone still called it that, even if most of the residents weren't pretty anymore -- not in the old sense, anyway. Prettyville was full of pixel-skins and surge-monkeys, and plenty of other strange new fads and fashions. You could choose among a million kinds of beauty or weirdness, or even keep your natural-born face your whole life. These days "pretty" meant whatever got you noticed.</p><p>But one thing about Prettyville was still the same: If you hadn't turned sixteen, you weren't supposed to go there. Not at night, when all the good stuff happened.</p><p>Especially if you were an extra, a loser, an unknown.</p><p>Gazing at the city, she felt engulfed by her own invisibility. Each of its sparkling lights stood for one of the million people who had never heard of Aya Fuse. Who probably never would.</p><p>She sighed, urging her hoverboard forward.</p><p>The government feeds always said that the Prettytime was gone forever, freeing humanity from centuries of bubbleheadedness. They claimed that the divisions among uglies, pretties, and crumblies had all been washed away. That the last three years had unleashed a host of new technologies, setting the future in motion again.</p><p>But as far as Aya could see, the mind-rain hadn't changed everything....</p><p>It still pretty much sucked, being fifteen.</p><p>Copyright � 2006 by Scott Westerfeld</p><p></p><p><b>TECH-HEADS</b></p><p>"Are you getting this?" she whispered.</p><p>Moggle was already shooting, the shimmer of safety fireworks reflecting from its lenses. Hot-air balloons swayed over the mansion, and revelers screamed down from the rooftops in bungee jackets. It looked like a party back in the old days: self-indulgent and eye-kickingly radiant.</p><p>At least, that was how Aya's older brother always described the Prettytime. Back then everyone had gotten one big operation on their sixteenth birthday. It made you beautiful, but secretly changed your personality, leaving you brain-missing and easily controlled.</p><p>Hiro hadn't been a bubblehead very long; he'd turned sixteen only a few months before the mind-rain had arrived and cured the pretties. He liked to claim that those months had been awful -- as if being shallow and vain was such a stretch for him. But he never denied that the parties had been awesome.</p><p>Not that Hiro would be here tonight; he was way too famous. Aya checked her eyescreen: the average face rank inside was about twenty thousand.

"We're not wanted here."</p><p>Aya flipped up the hood of her robe, and stepped out of the shadows.<br></p><p>Inside, the air was full of hovercams.

She lowered her head, making her way toward a cluster of Reputation Bombers. Here in public they all kept their hoods up, like a bunch of pre-Rusty Buddhist monks.

Broke and under siege, the young queen sought to build new alliances with the great powers of the Muslim world. She sent an emissary to the Shah of Iran, wooed the king of Morocco, and entered into an unprecedented alliance with the Ottoman Sultan Murad III, with whom she shared a lively correspondence.<br><br> <i>The Sultan and the Queen</i> tells the riveting and largely unknown story of the traders and adventurers who first went East to seek their fortunes&#x2014;and reveals how Elizabeth&#x2019;s fruitful alignment with the Islamic world, financed by England&#x2019;s first joint stock companies, paved the way for its transformation into a global commercial empire.</p><p><b>Jerry Brotton</b> is a professor of Renaissance studies at Queen Mary University of London. A renowned broadcaster and critic, he is the author of&nbsp;<i>Global Interests: Renaissance Art Between East and West&nbsp;</i>(with Lisa Jardine),&nbsp;<i>The Renaissance Bazaar</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Sale of the Late King&#x2019;s Goods,</i>&nbsp;a finalist for the Samuel Johnson Prize and the Hessell-Tiltman Prize,&nbsp;<i>Great Maps</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling, award-winning&nbsp;<i>A History of the World in Twelve Maps</i>, which has been translated into eleven languages. <i>The Sultan and the Queen</i>&nbsp;published as&nbsp;<i>This Orient Isle</i>&nbsp;in the UK, was a Financial Times Book of the Year.<b>An Apt Man in Constantinople</b><br> &nbsp;<br> As news of the events in Morocco began to reach London in the autumn of 1578, Francis Walsingham concluded that it signaled the end of the fledgling Anglo-Moroccan alliance, almost before it had begun. Ever the pragmatist, he turned his attention elsewhere&#x2014;to the Ottomans. By the end of the year, the secretary of state and chief adviser on foreign affairs had written one of the most important documents in the early history of Anglo-Turkish relations, his &#x201c;Memorandum on the Turkey trade, written for Elizabeth and her counselors, which would become the blueprint for all subsequent Elizabethan relations with the Ottoman Empire.<br> &nbsp;<br> Characteristic in its attention to detail and unrivaled grasp of reasons of state, Walsingham&#x2019;s memo sought to justify the trade and to anticipate every eventuality. The English experience in Russia, Persia and more recently Morocco had taught him that it was vital to establish a trading presence before developing more formal political alliances, so he began by outlining &#x201c;the profit that may ensue by trade into the Turk&#x2019;s dominions.&#x201d; He argued that it would strengthen the navy&#x2019;s role in national defense and international commerce, allow merchants to export English goods directly into Turkish markets rather than through costly middlemen, and enable the importation of duty-free Turkish goods, which could then be sold across Europe. The obstacles were manifold: Walsingham understood that all the great Catholic powers with an interest in Mediterranean commerce would attempt to stop the trade, &#x201c;by finesse and by force.&#x201d; He observed drily that Spain, &#x201c;being not the best effected toward us,&#x201d; would undoubtedly concoct a strategic diplomatic and naval alliance with the French and Venetians to prevent the English trade. The difficulties would be all the greater once, as Walsingham correctly predicted, Philip &#x201c;is possessed of the kingdom of Portugal.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Walsingham&#x2019;s solution was to &#x201c;make choice of some apt man to be sent with her Majesty&#x2019;s letters unto the Turk to procure an ample safeconduct, who is always to remain there at the charge of the merchants.&#x201d; It was a shrewd proposal. Whoever was chosen would exploit the blurred line between trade and politics, traveling under royal warrant but paid for by London&#x2019;s merchants, giving the queen maximum diplomatic returns on a minimum financial investment. He would remain in Constantinople indefinitely to thwart attempts by resident Venetian, French and Spanish merchants or diplomats to disrupt the English trade.<br> &nbsp;<br> Walsingham stressed that the first visit was &#x201c;to be handled with great secrecy&#x201d; and undertaken overland initially to prevent news of a seaborne departure from London reaching the ears of Constantinople&#x2019;s resident ambassadors. The ambitious long-term plan was for twenty English ships to sail annually through the Mediterranean during the winter months, with sufficient commodities to turn a profit in Turkey. But Walsingham worried: Could the English supply enough cloth to load twenty ships? Would such a flotilla flood the Turkish market and cause prices to crash? He also wondered &#x201c;whether there shall be that vent&#x201d; or sale &#x201c;of our kerseys during the wars between the said Turk and Sophy&#x201d; at the same levels of profit that existed prior to the conflict. Finally, he took up Edmund Hogan&#x2019;s plan for connecting the Moroccan trade with Constantinople, believing that it would be vital &#x201c;to procure the Turk&#x2019;s letters to the King of Barbary and the rest of the princes of Africa that the ports there may be free for our merchants.&#x201d; Walsingham was clearly nervous about the Moroccan royal succession following al-Malik&#x2019;s death and hoped&#x2014;rather optimistically&#x2014;that he could use Ottoman leverage to ensure unimpeded English commerce through the region.<br> &nbsp;<br> As Richard Hakluyt observed in his <i>Principal Navigations, </i>the &#x201c;apt man&#x201d; chosen to lead England&#x2019;s hazardous foray into the Turkish trade was William Harborne. Born in Great Yarmouth into a family of minor gentry, Harborne began traveling abroad as a factor in 1559. In 1577, with plans for a Turkish adventure already being mooted, he was named as one of the principal members of the newly formed Spanish Company, alongside Edward Osborne, Richard Staper and Anthony Jenkinson. Jenkinson&#x2019;s days of traveling to Russia and Persia were over by then, but if he and Harborne met during this period, the older man would surely have seen a kindred spirit in the younger. They certainly shared many of the attributes required to undertake such grueling and dangerous long-distance travels into the Islamic world. Both men were charismatic, tenacious and resourceful, both dedicated mercers and both loyal servants of their Protestant queen. Neither was above speaking his mind, even when such frankness threatened his career or his life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Like many English merchants of his time, Harborne was employed as a government spy before departing for Turkey, which suggests that his selection for the job resulted from the combined efforts of Osborne, Staper and Walsingham. Whatever the discussions behind his appointment, in early August 1578, just before the Battle of Alcacer-Quibir, Harborne was several weeks into a four-month overland journey to Constantinople, accompanied by Joseph Clements and just one servant. They traveled through Germany to Poland, where Harborne met his brother-in-law in Lvov (possibly the English factor John Wright), together with an Ottoman dragoman (a diplomatic translator and envoy) known as Mustafa Beg. It was his good fortune to arrive just at the moment when an Ottoman diplomatic delegation had come to renew a peace treaty between Poland and the new Turkish sultan, Murad III. Harborne joined Mustafa&#x2019;s diplomatic caravan as it headed back to Constantinople, taking a route advocated by Jenkinson back in 1561 through Moldavia, Romania and Bulgaria. He arrived in the Ottoman capital on October 28, 1578.<br> &nbsp;<br> What Harborne made of his arrival is not recorded, but as a Protestant English merchant from Norfolk he must have experienced some combination of exhilaration and trepidation. Constantinople, one of the world&#x2019;s greatest imperial capitals, had changed beyond all recognition since it had fallen to Sultan Mehmed II in 1453. The new city of Istanbul, from the Greek for &#x201c;to the city,&#x201d; was also referred to in official Ottoman business for centuries as Kostantiniyye, or, as Christians would continue to call it, Constantinople, the name I have used in this book. The Ottomans had transformed a Byzantine city in decline with a population of just 50,000 into the capital of the Islamic world, a vibrant multiethnic and multidenominational city. By the time Harborne arrived its population was estimated at 300,000 to 500,000, much larger than London (200,000), Paris (220,000), Naples (280,000) or Venice (160,000). From sheer political and commercial necessity, Mehmed and his successors (including Murad) had made Constantinople it into a cosmopolitan capital, repopulating it through the forced resettlement of merchants and craftsmen from various ethnic and religious backgrounds. Only 58 percent of the city was Muslim, with 32 percent Christian and 10 percent &#x201c;Jews,&#x201d; a category that included Greeks, Armenians and various communities deported from the recently conquered Balkans.<br> &nbsp;<br> To Harborne, the city&#x2019;s skyline must have appeared alien and intimidating.<br> At Mehmed&#x2019;s command, the iconic Greek Orthodox cathedral of Hagia Sophia had been transformed into a mosque, and an ambitious program of public building had begun. A new imperial palace, the Topkapi Sarayi, had been built overlooking the Golden Horn, as well as the Fatih Mosque and Kulliye (a complex of buildings of characteristic Ottoman architecture) and a commercial district dominated by a <i>bedestan</i> (the marketplace known today as the Grand Bazaar) and a series of <i>khans</i> (urban caravanserais). On the northern side of the Golden Horn, Mehmed had repopulated Galata&#x2014;still identified by its imposing Genoese tower&#x2014;with Jewish and Christian merchants, and this is where Harborne lived during his time in Constantinople. Under Mehmed 190 mosques, 24 madrasas (schools), 32 <i>hamams </i>(bathhouses) and 12 markets were erected, transforming the city from a Greek Orthodox polis into a Muslim capital. Under Mehmed&#x2019;s grandson Sultan Suleyman, the urban transformation was even more pronounced, thanks primarily to the extraordinary achievements of the architect Mimar Sinan, who built some 120 buildings in Constantinople, many of which Harborne would have seen. Foremost among these were the &#x15e;ehzade Mosque and the monumental Suleymaniye Mosque and Kulliye, completed twenty years before Harborne&#x2019;s arrival.<br> &nbsp;<br> Since his recent accession, in 1574, the young and pious new sultan Murad III had confined himself to proposing architectural projects outside his imperial capital. He commissioned a magnificent imperial mosque in his birthplace of Manisa, but this would not be completed for another eight years. Perhaps befitting his mystical beliefs, he was more interested in leaving his mark on the holy sites in Mecca and Medina. He built a new arcade around the revered Ka&#x2019;ba in Mecca, remodeled the Prophet&#x2019;s mosque in Medina and commissioned a range of new buildings in both cities, including madrasas, hospices and lodges for his beloved Sufi dervishes. Harborne could be forgiven for seeing little or no trace of the sultan he had come to court in Constantinople. Once installed as sultan, Murad rarely left his imperial palace in Constantinople, surrounding himself with scores of advisers, mystics, astrologers, poets, calligraphers and musicians.<br> &nbsp;<br> Harborne&#x2019;s initial encounters with this intensely hierarchical and labyrinthine Ottoman political bureaucracy must have been completely bewildering. The first problem was one of communication. Harborne corresponded with his Ottoman counterparts in Latin or Italian (in which he appears to have been fluent), which was then translated into Turkish, leaving much room (as we have seen) for creative license and strategic misunderstanding. Then there was the difficulty of gaining appropriate formal access to the Ottoman court.<br> &nbsp;<br> The French had developed the concept of the &#x201c;Sublime Porte&#x201d; or &#x201c;High Gate&#x201d; (in Turkish <i>Bab&#x131;ali</i>), through which foreign dignitaries were allowed to enter the Ottoman state buildings in an elaborate and carefully orchestrated procession. Any breach of etiquette could prove disastrous. Once within the imperial complex, centered on the Topkapi Palace, visitors had to navigate through the many layers of the sultan&#x2019;s court.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Inner Service, dominated by the harem, was responsible for the sultan&#x2019;s welfare. It included his wives, concubines and slaves. At the time of Harborne&#x2019;s arrival, the Inner Service was also, through the power granted to Murad&#x2019;s long-term lover or consort Safiye Sultan, exercising considerable influence over imperial policy. Fiscal and diplomatic responsibilities were delegated to the Outer Service and the so-called Scribal Institution, both of which were controlled by the grand vizier. The grand vizier, appointed by the sultan, held executive powers over an imperial advisory council (the <i>divan</i>) composed of viziers and pashas. The <i>divan </i>had in turn to compete with the demands of various social and economic ministries known as &#x201c;institutions.&#x201d; These included the Religious Institution and the Military Institution, the latter controlling the sultan&#x2019;s feared and unpredictable fighting corps, the Janissaries. To make matters even more confusing, the Ottoman ruling administration was divided between the Turkish nobility and the <i>dev&#x15f;irme </i>(abducted Christian youths), forcible converts to Islam who were loyal to the sultan&#x2019;s administrative or military institutions. Both groups claimed the title &#x201c;Osmanli&#x201d; or &#x201c;Ottoman&#x201d; to signify their membership in the state&#x2019;s ruling class, although in times of conflict each exploited the other&#x2019;s weaknesses for political gain. The sultans had adopted the <i>dev&#x15f;irme</i> system as a deliberate method of divide and rule, to play each group off the other, but it was a volatile setup that baffled outsiders.<br> &nbsp;<br> Harborne&#x2019;s first task was to establish a dialog with Murad&#x2019;s grand vizier, the seventy-three-year-old Sokollu Mehmed Pasha. Bosnian by birth, the wily Sokollu Mehmed was a <i>dev&#x15f;irme </i>who had risen rapidly through the Ottoman ranks before being appointed grand vizier by Suleyman in 1565. It was testament to his consummate political skill that Sokollu Mehmed had not only survived but prospered in that role for fourteen years under three different sultans; however, at the time of Harborne&#x2019;s arrival he was locked in a bitter power struggle with Murad&#x2019;s consort, Safiye Sultan.<br> &nbsp;<br> Harborne&#x2019;s disastrous start to his time in Constantinople was described in graphic detail in his earliest surviving correspondence, a petition submitted to Sokollu Mehmed, the first ever written to a grand vizier by a foreigner. Harborne submitted his petition, written in Italian, via a dragoman to the Ottoman Chancery, where it was translated into Turkish with all the formal conventions (it was customary for the plaintiff to write in the third person). Harborne complained that not long after his arrival he had ordered the goods and money left in Lvov to be sent to him by one of his servants, only for the servant to be &#x201c;assassinated by thieves within one day&#x2019;s journey of this famous city, and they robbed him of his goods and money to the sum of 4000 ducats,&#x201d; which was around &#xffe1;1,300.5 Considering that an average English ship&#x2019;s cargo was worth around &#xffe1;7,000, this was a substantial loss. The poor servant who lost his life remained anonymous, and was never mentioned again.<br> &nbsp;<br> The goods involved were the ubiquitous coarse woolen kersey cloths, as well as tin and lead, a flagrant violation of the papal ban on the trade of all such merchandise with Muslims. Harborne complained that the grand vizier knew the whereabouts of his servant&#x2019;s assassins as well as of his goods, but his <i>chiauses </i>(Turkish sergeants) &#x201c;have made no effort at all&#x2014;they did not even wish to go to find the merchandise where the thieves confessed that it was but, rather, wasted their time.&#x201d; Despite the apparent delicacy of the situation, Harborne managed to end his petition with a request for safe-conducts to trade throughout the Ottoman-controlled eastern Mediterranean, and for permission to export surplus lead.<br> &nbsp;<br> Neither Harborne&#x2019;s subsequent letters nor Ottoman Chancery records reveal if he received compensation for his losses, but he is unlikely to have been able to continue trading without some indemnity. Hakluyt certainly believed that Harborne turned his loss into broader profit, describing the canny Englishman as having &#x201c;behaved himself so wisely and discreetly that within a few months after he obtained himself not only the great Turk&#x2019;s large and ample privilege for himself . . . but also procured his honorable and friendly letters unto her Majesty.&#x201d; This was a very bland account of what really happened.<br> &nbsp;<br> The imperial ambassador to Constantinople, Joachim von Sinzendorf, had been keeping a suspicious eye on Harborne ever since his arrival. He reported to the Habsburg cou...</p><h2>A History of Christianity in the United States and Canada</h2><p>From the lively severities of the 17th-century Pilgrims and Puritans to the ebullience of the televanglism age, the Christian experience in North America is rich and varied. Noll covers it all in this superb narrative survey. Tracing the growth of Christian belief and institutions and their interactions with culture in the U.S. and Canada from the colonial period to the present, his approach is broad and comprehensive. Many biographical profiles add a personal dimension to the narrative.</p><p>Mark A. Noll is Francis A. McAnaney Professor of History at the University of Notre Dame.Noll has written a very readable textbook. Though dealing with all denominations, it is centered on the rise and decline of Protestant dominance in the United States. Starting from colonial pluralism, Noll shows how Christianity was Americanized by the "great awakening," the Revolution, and other influences. Evangelical America, he says, began to erode during the Civil War and declined further under the influence of modernism and the social gospel. Examining various trends and leaders, Noll predicts that the 20th century will witness a return to pluralism. Though a little weak on the past 40 years, his book is an excellent overview of American church history. Space is given to minority influences, and hymns are used to show the common worshiper's viewpoint. Especially useful and unique is his section on the church in Canada, which provides great comparison value. Recommended for libraries needing a good, basic history of the American church.<br><i>- C.

That's how the lights get in.&#x201d; And then the images flow, of light entering scenes through windows, clouds, and spotlights, from above, alongside, and behind, casting radiance upon young ballerinas and weathered men, into groves of autumn trees and island-dotted seas, revealing everything it touches to be beautiful beyond expectation.</p><p>To illuminate the theme of Wonder, Griffiths chose a wish from Andre Bazin: &#x201c;If I had influence with the good fairy...I should ask that her gift to each child in the world be a sense of wonder so indestructible that it would last throughout life.&#x201d; This thought is juxtaposed with an exquisite vision in white, a frame filled with the snowy-pure dots and rays of a bird&#x2019;s fan tail.

Seventy&nbsp;years later, released by widowhood, and to the dismay of her pompous children, she abandons the family home for a tiny house in Hampstead. Here she recollects the dreams of youth, and revels in&nbsp;her newfound freedom&nbsp;with her odd assortment of companions: Genoux, her French maid; Mr. Bucktrout, her house agent; and a coffin maker who pictures people dead in order to reveal their true characters.&nbsp;And then there's&nbsp;Mr. FitzGeorge, an eccentric millionaire who met and loved her in India when she was young and very lovely. It is here in this world of her own that she finds a passion that comes only with the freedom to choose, and it is this, her greatest gift, that she passes on to the only one who can understand its value. First published in 1931, Vita Sackville-West's masterpiece is the fictional companion to her great friend Virginia Woolf's<i> A Room of One's Own</i>.</p><p>Vita Sackville-West (1892-1962) was born and educated at Knole. She and her husband Harold Nicolson created the famous garden at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent.Henry Lyulph Holland, first Earl of Slane, had existed for so long that the public had begun to regard him as immortal. The public, as a whole, finds reassurance in longevity, and, after the necessary interlude of reaction, is disposed to recognise extreme old age as a sign of excellence. The long-liver has triumphed over at least one of man&#x2019;s initial handicaps: the brevity of life. To filch twenty years from eternal annihilation is to impose one&#x2019;s superiority on an allotted programme. So small is the scale upon which we arrange our values. It was thus with a start of real incredulity that City men, opening their papers in the train on a warm May morning, read that Lord Slane, at the age of ninety-four, had passed away suddenly after dinner on the previous evening. &#x2018;Heart failure,&#x2019; they said sagaciously, though they were actually quoting from the papers; and then added with a sigh, &#x2018;Well, another old landmark gone.&#x2019; That was the dominant feeling: another old landmark gone, another reminder of insecurity. All the events and progressions of Henry Holland&#x2019;s life were gathered up and recorded in a final burst of publicity by the papers; they were gathered together into a handful as hard as a cricket-ball, and flung in the faces of the public, from the days of his &#x2018;brilliant university career,&#x2019; through the days when Mr Holland, at an astonishingly early age, had occupied a seat in the Cabinet, to this very last day when as Earl of Slane, K.G., G.C.B., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., etc. etc. &#x2013; his diminishing honours trailing away behind him like the tail of a comet &#x2013; he had drooped in his chair after dinner, and the accumulation of ninety years had receded abruptly into history. Time seemed to have made a little jump forward, now that the figure of old Slane was no longer there with outstretched arms to dam it back. For some fifteen years he had taken no very active part in public life, but he had been there, and on occasion the irrefutable suavity, common sense, and mockery of his eloquence in Parliament had disturbed, though it could not actually arrest, his more extreme colleagues upon the brink of folly. Such pronouncements had been rare, for Henry Holland had always been a man to appreciate the value of economy, but by their very rarity they produced a wholesome sense of uneasiness, since men knew them to be backed up by a legend of experience: if the old man, the octogenarian, the nonagenarian, could bestir himself to the extent of stalking down to Westminster and unburdening himself, in his incomparable way, of opinions carefully, soberly, but cynically gestated, then the Press and the public were compelled into attention. Nobody had ever seriously attacked Lord Slane. Nobody had ever accused Lord Slane of being a back-number. His humour, his charm, his languor, and his good sense, had rendered him sacrosanct to all generations and to all parties; of him alone among statesmen and politicians, perhaps, could that be said. Perhaps, because he seemed to have touched life on every side, and yet never seemed to have touched life, the common life, at all, by virtue of his proverbial detachment, he had never drawn upon himself the execration and mistrust commonly accorded to the mere expert. Hedonist, humanist, sportsman, philosopher, scholar, charmer, wit; one of those rare Englishmen whose fortune it is to be born equipped with a truly adult mind. His colleagues and his subordinates had been alternately delighted and infuriated by his assumed reluctance to deal with any practical question. It was difficult to get a yes or a no out of the man. The more important a question was, the more flippantly he dealt with it. &#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; he would write at the bottom of a memorandum setting forth the advantages of two opposite lines of policy; and his myrmidons passed their hands over their brows, distraught. He was destroyed as a statesman, they said, because he always saw both sides of the case; but even as they said it with exasperation, they did not mean it, for they knew that on occasion, when finally pushed into a corner, he would be more incisive, more deadly, than any man seated four-square and full of importance at a governmental desk. He could cast his eye over a report, and pick out its heart and its weakness before another man had had time to read it through. In his exquisitely courteous way, he would annihilate alike the optimism and the myopia of his correspondent. Courteous always, and civilised, he left his competitors dead.<br><br>&nbsp;His personal idiosyncrasies, too, were dear to the public as to the caricaturists; his black satin stock, his eyeglass swung on an extravagantly wide ribbon, the coral buttons to his evening waistcoat, the private hansom he maintained long after motors had come into fashion &#x2013; by all this was he buttressed through the confused justice and injustice of legend; and when, at the age of eighty-five, he finally succeeded in winning the Derby, no man ever received a greater ovation. His wife alone suspected how closely those idiosyncrasies were associated with a settled policy. The least cynical of people by nature, she had learned to lay a veneer of cynicism over herself after seventy years&#x2019; association with Henry Holland. &#x2018;Dear old man,&#x2019; said the City men in the train; &#x2018;well, he&#x2019;s gone.&#x2019;<br><br>He was gone indeed, very finally and irretrievably gone. So thought his widow, looking down at him as he lay on his bed in Elm Park Gardens. The blinds were not lowered, for he had always stipulated that when he came to die the house should not be darkened, and even after his death nobody would have dreamed of disobeying his orders. He lay there in the full sunlight, sparing the stone-mason the trouble of carving his effigy. His favourite great-grandchild, to whom everything was permitted, had often twitted him, saying that he would make a handsome corpse; and now that the joke had become a reality, the reality gained in impressiveness for having been anticipated by a joke. His was the type of face which, even in life, one associates prophetically with the high dignity of death. The bony architecture of nose, chin, and temples, stood out in greater relief for the slight sinking of the flesh; the lips took a firmer line, and a lifetime of wisdom lay sealed behind them. Moreover, and most importantly, Lord Slane looked as soign� in death as he had looked in life. &#x2018;Here,&#x2019; you would say, even though the bedclothes covered him, &#x2018;is a dandy.&#x2019;<br><br>Yet, for all its dignity, death brought a revelation. The face which had been so noble in life lost a trifle of its nobility in death; the lips which had been too humorous to be unpleasantly sardonic now betrayed their thinness; the carefully concealed ambition now revealed itself fully in the proud curve of the nostril. The hardness which had disguised itself under the charming manner now remained alone, robbed of the protection of a smile. He was beautiful, but he was less agreeable. Alone in the room his widow contemplated him, filled with thoughts that would greatly have surprised her children, could they but have read her mind.<br><br>Her children, however, were not there to observe her. They were collected in the drawing-room, all six of them; two wives and a husband bringing the number up to nine. A sufficiently formidable family gathering &#x2013; old, black ravens, thought Edith, the youngest, who was always flustered and always trying to confine things into the shape of a phrase, like pouring water into a ewer, but great gouts of meaning and implication invariably ran over and slopped about and were lost. To attempt to recapture them after they had spilt was as hopeless as trying to hold the water in your hand. Perhaps, if one had a notebook and pencil always ready &#x2013; but then the thought would be lost while one was looking for the right word; and, moreover, it would be difficult to use a notebook without everybody seeing. Shorthand? &#x2013; but one must not let one&#x2019;s thoughts run on like this; one must discipline one&#x2019;s mind, keeping one&#x2019;s attention on the present matter, as other people seemed to do without any difficulty; though, to be sure, if one had not learnt that lesson by the time one was sixty, one was never likely to learn it. A formidable family gathering, thought Edith, coming back: Herbert, Carrie, Charles, William, and Kay; Mabel, Lavinia; Roland. They went in groups: the Hollands themselves, the sisters-in-law, the brother-in-law; then they sorted themselves differently: Herbert and Mabel, Carrie and Roland; Charles; William and Lavinia; and then Kay all by himself. It was not often that they all met together, none missing &#x2013; curious, Edith thought, that Death should be the convener, as though all the living rushed instantly together for protection and mutual support. Dear me, how old we all are. Herbert must be sixty-eight, and I&#x2019;m sixty; and Father was over ninety, and Mother is eighty-eight. Edith, who had begun making a sum of their total ages, surprised them all very much by asking, &#x2018;How old are you, Lavinia?&#x2019; Thus taken aback, they rebuked Edith by their stare; but that was Edith all over, she never listened to what was being said, and then suddenly came out with some irrelevant remark. Edith could have told them that all her life she had been trying to say what she meant, and had never yet succeeded. Only too often, she said something precisely the opposite of what she wanted to say. Her terror was that she should one day use an indecent word by mistake. &#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t it splendid that Father is dead,&#x2019; she might say, instead of, &#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t it terrible&#x2019;; and there were other possibilities, even more appalling, by which one might use a really dreadful word,&nbsp; the sort of word that butcher-boys scrawled in pencil on the white-washed walls of the basement passage, and about which one had to speak, most evasively, to the cook. An unpleasant task; the sort of task that fell to Edith in Elm Park Gardens and to a thousand Ediths all over London. But of these preoccupations her family knew nothing.<br><br>They were gratified now to see that she blushed, and that her hands went up nervously to fiddle with the grey strands of her hair; the gesture implied that she had not spoken. Having reduced her to this confusion, they returned to their conversation, suitably hushed and mournful. Even the voices of Herbert and Carrie, habitually insistent, were lowered. Their father lay upstairs, and their mother was with him.<br><br>&#x2018;Mother is wonderful.&#x2019;<br><br>Over and over, thought Edith, they had reiterated that phrase. Surprise was in their accents, as though they had expected their mother to rant, rave, scream, give herself up for lost. Edith knew very well that her brothers and sister privately entertained a theory that their mother was rather a simpleton. From time to time she let fall remarks that could not be reconciled with ordinary sense; she had no grasp on the world as it was; she was apt to say impetuous things which, although uttered in English, made no more sense than had they been uttered in an outer-planetary language. Mother was a changeling, they had often said politely, in the bitter-sweet accents reserved for a family joke; but now in this emergency they found a new phrase: Mother is wonderful. It was the thing they were expected to say, so they said it, several times over, like a refrain coming periodically into their conversation and sweeping it upwards on to a higher level. Then it drooped again; became practical. Mother was wonderful, but what was to be done with Mother? Evidently, she could not go on being wonderful for the rest of her life. Somewhere, somehow, she must be allowed to break down, and then, after that was over, must be stowed away; housed, taken care of. Outside, in the streets, the posters might flare: death of Lord Slane. The journalists might run up and down Fleet Street assembling their copy; they might pounce on the pigeon-holes &#x2013; that macabre columbarium &#x2013; where the obituary notices were stored in readiness; they might raid each other&#x2019;s information: &#x2018;I say, is it true that old Slane always carried his cash in coppers? wore cr�pe soles? dipped his bread in his coffee?&#x2019; Anything to make a good paragraph. Telegraph-boys might ring the bell, propping their red bicycles against the kerb, delivering their brown messages of condolence, from all over the world, from all parts of the Empire, especially where Lord Slane had served his term of government. Florists might deliver their wreaths &#x2013; already the narrow hall was full of them &#x2013; &#x2018;indecently soon,&#x2019; said Herbert, peering jealously nevertheless at the attached cards through his monocle. Old friends might call &#x2013; &#x2018;Herbert &#x2013; so dreadfully sudden &#x2013; of course, I didn&#x2019;t expect to see your dear Mother&#x2014;&#x2019; But obviously they had expected it, had expected to be the sole exception, and Herbert must turn them away, rather enjoying it: &#x2018;Mother, you understand, is naturally rather overcome; wonderful, I must say; but just at present, you&#x2019;ll understand, I&#x2019;m sure, is seeing nobody but Us&#x2019;; and so with many pressings of Herbert&#x2019;s hand they took their departure, having got no further than the hall or the doorstep. Reporters might loiter on the pavement, dangling cameras like black concertinas. All this might go on outside the house, but inside it, upstairs, Mother was with Father and the problem of her future lay heavy upon her sons and daughters.</p><h2>Bella Figura: How to Live, Love, and Eat the Italian Way</h2><p><i>&#x201c;She walks down the street with a swing in her step and a lift to her head.

She radiates allure as if followed by a personal spotlight. She may be tall or short, slim or pneumatically curvaceous, dressed discreetly or ostentatiously&#x2014;it matters not. Her gait, her composure, the very tilt of her head is an ode to grace and self-possession that makes her beautiful whatever her actual features reveal. She is Sophia Loren, Gina Lollobrigida, Claudia Cardinale, Monica Bellucci. She is the Italian woman glorified on celluloid and on the nightly <i>passeggiata </i>you see on your Italian vacations&#x2014;but she is no figment of the adman&#x2019;s imagination. She is real and gracing the streets of every city, town, and village in Italy right now. She is the embodiment of <i>bella figura</i> and she cuts an elegant dash through our mundane modern world.<br><br>When I arrived in Florence, I could not have been further from this ideal. Decades of working at the computer had rounded my shoulders, years of looking down into a laptop or phone had slackened my jawline and compressed my neck. The stress of a demanding job and big-city life had hardened my features. My eyes were fixed to the ground as I hurried through life, with no time to throw anyone a smile let alone a kind word. Single for years, my loneliness&nbsp;had calcified. I didn&#x2019;t so much strut with confidence as cringe down the street.<br><br>A year in Florence&#x2014;and discovering <i>bella figura</i>&#x2014;changed my life.<br><br>The concept of <i>bella figura</i> is about making every aspect of life as beautiful as it can be, whether in Rome, London, New York, or Vancouver. It is a notion at once romantic and practical. It encompasses everything we do, from what we eat to how we get to work in the mornings. It&#x2019;s about sensuality and sexuality. It&#x2019;s about banishing the stress that, no matter how few carbs we eat and how vigorously we exercise, means our bodies are so shut down we can only ever look harrowed and pinched. <i>Bella figura</i> is about generosity and abundance, not meanness or deprivation. The Italian woman who lives the <i>bella figura </i>knows the importance of beautiful manners and a graceful demeanor, not as a nod to a bygone era, but as a means of &#x201c;making the face&#x201d; until it fits&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a proven fact that if we smile genuinely often enough, we release the happy hormone serotonin. All of this improves not only our quality of life but also the quantity of years we have.<br><br>While this book will touch on details about already well-documented benefits of the Mediterranean diet, what follows in these pages is, instead, the story of a journey. Ten years ago I moved to Florence quite by accident, and that first year I spent there changed my life, my body, and the shape of my heart. I believe that what I learned can change yours too.<br><b>Chapter 1 - <i>Festina lente</i> or How to Slow Down</b><br><br><i>January 2008</i><br><br>It all began with rain.&nbsp;It fell in heavy sheets as I was lined up waiting for a taxi at Santa Maria Novella train station in Florence. The line was not under cover and I didn&#x2019;t have an umbrella. By the time I got into the cab, I was soaking wet.<br><br>I was in a city where I didn&#x2019;t know a soul, unanchored from work, friends and family, a piece of human flotsam washed up in its Renaissance gutters. All I had, clutched in my damp hand, was the address of the apartment where I was to stay. As I reached the top of the line, I uncrumpled it, showed it to the cab driver, and got in. He grunted and pulled out, frowning at the thought of a puddle forming at my feet behind him.<br><br>We swept through the slick cobbled streets. The heating was on full blast and my sodden coat was fogging up the cab. I peered through steamed-up windows at the stone walls of ancient buildings rising up on either side of the road, water dripping off their deep eaves. The streets were deserted&#x2014;it was January 2 and the city was still sleeping off its hangover. My own New Year&#x2019;s Eve had been spent stuffing boxes into corners in my parents&#x2019; apartment under the beady eye of my mother, who said nothing but whose every breath asked me what on earth I thought I was doing, giving up a good apartment and a job so prestigious it came with embossed business cards to move my possessions into her already overcrowded apartment and flit off to Florence to play at being a writer. I may as well have announced I was going to Italy to run a brothel.<br>The cab driver slowed down, gestured to the left and grunted. I turned around to take in the majestic proportions of a colonnaded piazza, a cathedral looming up at the end of the square, its white fa�ade reflected in the glistening ground. My mouth fell open.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t just the beauty of the square, but the theatricality of it too; the way the eye was led to the fa�ade of the church. &#x201c;<i>Si chiama Santa Croce</i>,&#x201d; the driver said. Then, indicating the statue of a scowling man, he said, &#x201c;<i>E quello li � Dante</i>.&#x201d; Dante looked as grumpy and bad-tempered as my cab driver, yet I was cheered. The man credited with inventing the modern Italian language in his <i>Divine Comedy</i> was standing right there, holding a book in his stony hands, looking at me with his basilisk stare. It was a good omen.<br><br>The basilica stood solidly behind Dante&#x2019;s statue, the entire square constructed to induce awe in the insignificant human approaching it, as well as delight and marvel in the beauty. It was my first brush with the perfection of Italian presentation, the importance of the harmony of form, the genius of the impact on the onlooker, the moral weight given to beauty. It was <i>bella figura</i> embodied in stone and marble.<br><br>We crossed a nondescript bridge. This time the cabbie pointed to the right where the Ponte Vecchio squatted over the river on low arches. Lit up against the night, its row of matchbox shops hanging over the water, it shimmered like a dream. I took it in, wide-eyed, as we drove on, swinging into the Oltrarno, the other side of the River Arno from the historic center, winding through cobbled streets to pull up at my new front door.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Eccoci</i>,&#x201d; the driver said as he heaved himself from his seat. I paid and stepped out straight into a puddle. I hurried into the entrance hall, taking in its cavernous proportions as I dripped onto the flagstone floor. A flight of wide stone stairs twisted off to the right and I lugged my bags up, stopping to rest on a narrow bench on what felt like the 108th floor, panting. It was still a long way from the top. The steps dipped in the middle, worn by centuries of feet: the building dated from the seventeenth century, the silence thick with ghosts. I resumed my climb and finally stood in front of a Tiffany-blue door, its paint cracked and curling. The lock was a massive iron box with a large keyhole&#x2014;fortified, ancient. I pulled out an equally antiquated-looking key and opened the door.<br><br>A long corridor with a rough stone floor stretched away from me. It was freezing, my breath fogged into the air. Halfway down I found a dark bedroom with two single beds and an enormous wooden chest of drawers, and I dropped my bags before going back out into the corridor to find the heating, switching it on, shedding my wet coat, and grabbing a blanket and wrapping it tight around me.<br><br>The apartment, which would be my new home for who-knew-how-long, was stuffy as well as cold. The corridor opened into a chain of rooms linking one to the next, what interior-design magazines call a shotgun apartment: a sitting room with large, shuttered casement windows, a sofa bed and a rickety table with haphazard piles of books. A long and spacious kitchen led off the top of the sitting room. The sink, cupboards, and oven ranged along the right, while, on the left, a table sat under another set of double windows. At the far end of the kitchen, another sitting room was set at a right angle, with a long corner sofa, behind which a shelving unit was wobbly with stacks of books. In the far corner, the only door in the whole apartment apart from the front door closed off a small bathroom.<br><br>I regarded myself in the mirror above the sink: my hair was frizzy from the journey, there were shadows under my eyes, and I could see the glowing red mark of a new spot erupting on my chin. Or chins, I should say. My Big Job had made me hate my reflection. The years had been marked by inexplicable, distressing weight gain: rolls appearing not just around my middle but on my back, under my face, hanging from my upper arms; I tried every healthy diet going and eliminated every kind of bad food as identified by the latest fad, to no avail. Acne, which had given me a wide berth when I was a teenager, came to get me with gusto; my skin had broken out. I tried not to care, but the industry I worked in made that impossible&#x2014;a glossy magazine company in which the daily elevator ride required nerves of steel, a pre-season designer wardrobe, and the insouciance of Kate Moss. I had draped myself in black shapeless clothes instead and avoided the elevator.<br><br>I sighed and turned away, going back to the windows in the kitchen. In spite of the cold and the rain, I threw them open and leaned forward, peering into the darkness.<br><br>Outside, a dark, silent courtyard was overlooked by windows, balconies, and terra-cotta roofs. On the far side watching over it all was the tower of the local church, a slim stone structure from the seventeenth century. Four green bells peeked through small arches, a jigsaw of brickwork around the top the only decoration. All around, the windows of the other apartments were dark. Rain fell into the silence.<br><br>Christobel&#x2019;s tower, I thought, remembering the first time I had heard about it.<br><br>I had met Christobel when I accepted a last-minute invitation to vacation at a friend&#x2019;s home in France. Christobel was another guest. She had white hair with a stripe of black running down the middle, and a diamond that glittered in the corner of her nose. An unlikely look for a fairy godmother, but then, Disney never dreamed up one as sassy and smart as Christobel.<br><br>I learned that she was a novelist, wife to a Cambridge academic and mother to five children. She told me how she had fallen in love with Italy when she had spent a year in Florence teaching English. She had traveled back regularly, and somewhere along the line had bought an apartment, talking dreamily of a courtyard and a church tower. She managed a visit most months&#x2014;two days in which to be alone, no children tugging at her skirt, to wander the streets visiting her favorite haunts for cappuccinos, for designer frocks, and handmade shoes. She wrote it all into thrillers set in the city, her characters retracing the steps she took around town, her plots imagining the dark underbelly of the place she loved for its beauty but was compelled by for its mystery. She had published three novels and was working on her fourth. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine how she fitted it all in. &#x201c;I have a full-time job and a cat, and I still can&#x2019;t figure out how to wash my hair during the week,&#x201d; I had said, and, laughing, we had bonded.<br><br>Lying under an olive tree one hot day, Christobel had suggested that I retreat to her apartment in Florence to write the book I dreamed of undertaking. I had scoffed at the time&#x2014;it was a lovely dream but as far from my reality as could be.

Back matter suggests further reading.</p><p>Grade 4-6-The most famous image of Nefertiti is a carved bust attributed to the sculptor Tutmose. This is the story of the artist as a child, son of Harkhuf the animal dealer. Tutmose and his brother, Ibrim, who is blind, go to live with the pharaoh Akhenaten, and Harkhuf receives honors such as being made a "Man of Gold." The boys love their new life; Tutmose studies sculpture and Ibrim learns to play the harp. But Harkhuf is a devout follower of the old gods, and Akhenaten has declared Aten, the Sun God, as the only true god. Tutmose is torn between his father's beliefs and those of the pharaoh. He is finally convinced that the pharaoh is right, and becomes a devotee of Aten. His father, however, turns fanatical and decides that Akhenaten must be destroyed, insisting that Tutmose help him. McCaughrean has told a fine story, and though the themes and vocabulary may be advanced for the intended audience, readers will most likely just enjoy the story.

As their reed boat sinks into the Nile and hungry crocodiles approach, narrator Tutmose, his brother Ibrim, and father Harkhuf are rescued by the pharaoh, Akhenaten. Akhenaten insists that the boys become royal apprentices and bestows honors on Harkhuf. The boys thrive in the royal setting, but Harkhuf continues to worship the traditional gods rather than the pharaoh's single god, Aten. When Harkhuf conspires to kill the pharaoh to restore traditional religion, Tutmose must choose between his father and his pharaoh.

When she and her artist husband returned to the farm that had been in her family for a hundred years, she began a series based on her own background. The first book, <i>Bootlegger's Daughter</i>, became a <i>Washington Post </i>bestseller that swept the major mystery awards for its year-winning the Edgar, Agatha, Anthony, and Macavity Awards for Best Novel-and is among the 100 Favorite Mysteries of the Century as selected by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. Later Deborah Knott novels <i>Up Jumps the Devil</i>, <i>Storm Track</i>, and <i>Three-Day Town</i> each also won the Agatha Award for Best Novel. Margaret is also the author of the Sigrid Harald series of detective novels. In 2008, Maron received the North Carolina Award for Literature, the highest civilian honor the state bestows on its authors.

To find out more about her, you can visit MargaretMaron.com.Maron's Judge Deborah Knott series is one of those cozy-procedural combos whose fans relish being part of the daily lives of the characters. This eleventh installment in the series will be treasured by those devotees with the same fervor that soap fans feel for a pivotal episode. It's Christmas, which means plenty of -family-friendly celebrating among Judge Knott's enormous clan in Colleton County, North Carolina, but more than that, the long-awaited marriage between Deborah and Deputy Sheriff Dwight Bryant is about to happen. Amid the myriad domestic details, there is also murder: the shooting of an assistant DA leads back to an earlier murder trial and the possibility that a soon-to-be-executed woman may be innocent. Readers new to this series may find the domesticity a bit overwhelming--a full page on the question of whether the wedding rice bags should be filled with birdseed?--but Deborah's fans will want to hear it all. And give Maron credit: her ability to evoke the camaraderie shared by small-town friends and family is almost enticing enough to make Woody Allen consider moving to North Carolina. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I was convinced from an early age that I was born in the wrong century and spent much of my childhood under the dining room table pretending it was a covered wagon. Even there, I was never without a book in hand and loved reading and history more than anything. I studied English Literature and Medieval History at the University of Notre Dame. Writing is a natural offshoot of reading, and my first novel,&nbsp;<i>And Only to Deceive</i>, was published in 2005. I'm the author of the long-running Lady Emily Series as well as the novel&nbsp;<i>Elizabeth: The Golden Age</i>. One of the best parts of being an author is seeing your books translated, and I'm currently in love with the Japanese editions of the Emily books.&nbsp;<br><br><br>I played nomad for a long time, living in Indiana, Amsterdam, London, Wyoming, Vermont, Connecticut, and Tennessee before settling down. My husband, the brilliant British novelist&nbsp;Andrew Grant&nbsp;(I may be biased but that doesn't mean I'm wrong) and I now divide our time between Chicago and Wyoming. He makes sure I get my English characters right, and I make sure his American ones sound American.1 <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;This, Emily, goes beyond bad manners.&#x201d; Lady Catherine Bromley squared her shoulders, shook her head without displacing a single silver hair, and glowered at me, her only daughter. &#x201c;One cannot have gentlemen falling down dead in the library, especially on an eighteenth-century Axminster carpet! It is entirely ruined; there is no possibility that bloodstain will come out. Such a thing would never be tolerated at Darnley House. What would your father say? I thank heaven that estate business took him home before he could see this.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The dead are notoriously unreliable when it comes to standards of behavior,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Particularly murder victims. They have no sense of decorum at all.&#x201d; <br>Another evening <i>en famille</i> at Anglemore Park. <br>Anglemore, prettily situated in Derbyshire in the midst of the Peak District, had been the seat of the Hargreaves family since Henry V&#x2019;s victory at Agincourt, after which the land had been given by the grateful king to one of my husband&#x2019;s ancestors for bravery in battle. During the reign of Henry VIII, the grounds, through a royal grant, expanded to include a nearby abbey, defunct after the reformation and all but destroyed by Cromwell&#x2019;s men. Its ruins, perched near a large lake, were some of the most picturesque in all of England, as if the structure had crumbled with deliberately artistic intent. The main house, originally built in the fifteenth century, had been added to and altered over the years, leaving it now with an Elizabethan exterior replete with rows of the most charming bay windows giving nearly every room a perfect nook for reading and none of the museum-like feel of so many great estates. <br>Anglemore was a house that was loved, a house that had sheltered the same family for more than four centuries. Generations of Hargreaves children (all born on the estate&#x2014;no other location would be tolerated, even today) had carved their initials in the wooden bannister on the back stairs leading to the nursery. The family was rooted here, passionate about the land, deeply connected to their tenants, and confident beyond doubt that there was no better place to serve as one&#x2019;s anchor. Most of the family married in the chapel, and all of them were buried on the grounds in a towering mausoleum built in the late seventeenth century by a Hargreaves gentleman who, horrified by the Great Plague, determined he must make every effort to see his mortal remains well placed. In a letter written during the height of the epidemic, his wife, angry with him for spending what she viewed as too much time hunting, had threatened him with plague pits. <br>Today, despite tens of thousands of acres of land, a sizable house, and enough outbuildings to hold several villages, the estate felt nothing but crowded. Crowded by my visiting mother, the Countess Catherine Bromley, whose inflexible views on child rearing, wholly at odds with my own, had not contributed to a state one could describe as domestic bliss. She had come to Anglemore months ago, following the birth of our twins, but had not stayed long, informing us she would return once the London Season had finished and after she had hosted at least two shooting parties. Only then, she said, would she have the presence of mind and clarity of concentration to ensure the children were being looked after properly. Now we were bearing the full brunt of this mission. Her visit had weeks ago taken on the feeling of an endless tour through one of Dante&#x2019;s less pleasant circles of hell. <br>The evening had started badly, with her complaining bitterly about each course at dinner. She had found fault with the game dish in particular, objecting to pheasant stuffed with foie gras for reasons wholly indecipherable to me. Afterward, we had retired to the library, where our second houseguest, Simon Lancaster, Earl Flyte, offered his apologies and went to bed after having been interrogated by her on the subject of politics. One could hardly blame the poor man. Unhappy with his views, she had hounded him, all but following him to his room when he at last excused himself. My husband, Colin Hargreaves, buried himself in James&#x2019;s <i>The Portrait of a Lady,</i> ignoring with deft skill my mother&#x2019;s litany of questions about his views on how our boys ought to be raised. She had, it seemed, either grown fatigued of political discussion or realized she would be incapable of besting him on the subject. Eventually forced to accept that she was quite unable to penetrate his wall, she turned her attention to reprimanding a housemaid for not having tended adequately to the fire&#x2014;a fire I was not convinced we needed on such a fine night. <br>&#x201c;There are infants in the house,&#x201d; my mother said. &#x201c;I shall not allow Henry or Richard to catch a chill.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Or Tom, Mother,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You mustn&#x2019;t forget Tom.&#x201d; It was the presence of this third child, our ward, that caused my mother considerable agitation. &#x201c;They are all two floors and one wing removed from us, not to mention in the care of an exceptionally capable nanny and her staff. I shouldn&#x2019;t worry if I were you. Furthermore, it is an unusually warm evening. They are more likely to be overheated than cold.&#x201d; To demonstrate the point, I crossed the room and flung open all six sets of French doors overlooking the neatly manicured terrace, its beds full of bright dahlias, chrysanthemums, and late asters. Autumn was at its best, a perfect September night. The sun had disappeared while we were in the dining room, leaving only a few streaks of gold in the inky sky. I pulled something to read down from the shelf without glancing at the title and installed myself in an overstuffed chair as far from the fireplace as possible. Nothing, I vowed silently, would distract me from this book. <br>Should it have become necessary, honoring this promise would have proved exceedingly difficult. The volume I had so carelessly chosen, a treatise on advanced mathematical theorems, had no hope of holding my attention for long, but it did not need to. No sooner had I soldiered through the introductory pages than the previously mentioned gentleman, tall and broad in his evening kit, staggered through one of the French doors. He braced himself on the frame, looked at Colin, took one step in his direction, and collapsed facedown on the floor. <br>My mother shrieked in a fashion so decidedly unladylike she would have been horrified to hear it. She swayed, unsteady on her feet, and appeared on the verge of fainting. I dashed to her side, took her firmly by the shoulders, and turned her to face me. <br>&#x201c;Now is not the time, Mother,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Do try to remember there are no smelling salts allowed in this house. Perish any thought you had of fainting.&#x201d; <br>The words&#x2014;and, no doubt, my tone&#x2014;shocked her into compliance, just as I had hoped. The color did not return to her visage, but she steeled herself, pulled her back straight, and looked away from the scene developing before us. There was no time to comfort her. We needed to focus on the injured man. <br>My husband, a trusted agent of the Crown and, hence, no stranger to trauma, disruption, and brutality, motioned for me to stay back while he knelt beside the prostrate stranger. <br>&#x201c;His heart is not beating,&#x201d; Colin said, &#x201c;and he is not breathing.&#x201d; His lips firm in a tight line, he closed the man&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;I am afraid there is nothing to be done.&#x201d; I moved closer, standing behind him, watching as he carefully inspected the corpse for injuries. <br>&#x201c;He is dead?&#x201d; My mother&#x2019;s voice was rising to a screech. She pressed with trembling hands a linen handkerchief to her face. &#x201c;This is too dreadful. I cannot bear it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Do try to be calm, Lady Bromley,&#x201d; Colin said. &#x201c;Hysteria will help no one.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a fierce scratch on his left hand,&#x201d; I said, ignoring my mother, who had started to sway again. This time I was willing to let her faint, although I doubted she would bother when the odds of anyone catching her were so low. <br>&#x201c;He may have been fighting.&#x201d; Colin lifted the man&#x2019;s head to reveal a deep gash splitting the skull, blood congealing on the carpet beneath it. <br>&#x201c;Have you any idea who he is?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;He is wholly unfamiliar to me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;None,&#x201d; Colin said. <br>This admission revived my mother. She took a step towards us, made a point of forcing herself to look at the unfortunate corpse, and spoke, her voice loaded with a mixture of disgust and condescension. &#x201c;That is Archibald Scolfield, the new Marquess of Montagu. He arrived from London yesterday. You ought to have known that, Emily, given that he&#x2019;s to be your nearest&#x2014;and titled&#x2014;neighbor. His cousin Matilda was hosting a party for him this evening. A party I believe you didn&#x2019;t bother to attend.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, I sent her our regrets,&#x201d; I said, noticing that my mother&#x2019;s face had gone an alarming shade of gray as she approached the body. She, unlike me, was not used to violent death. I had initially become close to Colin while trying to solve the murder of my first husband, Philip, Viscount Ashton. While embroiled in the case, I discovered I possessed a certain aptitude for the work, and had subsequently contributed to the arrests of six more violent criminals, earning for myself a reputation as a solid investigator. Colin and I, now married, made an excellent team, as even the queen herself had been forced to admit on more than one occasion. <br>I stepped to the marble fireplace, over which hung a fragment of a Roman fresco depicting a joyful scene of marriage, and rang the bell next to it. &#x201c;We ought to summon the authorities.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The authorities?&#x201d; The color rushed back into my mother&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be absurd. Lord Montagu fell and hit his head, probably on a rock. Why on earth would you involve the police or sheriff or whatever unseemly sort of <i>authority</i> is to be found? Send for your personal physician and insist he sign a death certificate at once and be done with the dreadful business. Gentlemen ought not to be so cavalier about wandering around the countryside after dark.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nothing about this situation suggests an accident,&#x201d; Colin said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid we&#x2019;ve no choice but to summon the police, Lady Bromley.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Do you want a scandal?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;On your own estate?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Surely, Mother, you are not questioning my husband&#x2019;s judgment?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;I can assure you he&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It is quite all right, Emily,&#x201d; Colin said. &#x201c;Your mother has nothing but the best of intentions. However, Lady Bromley, given my position, it is essential I report this incident with no delay. To do otherwise would be less than honorable. Perhaps you would like to retire upstairs for a bit? It will give you a chance to recover from the shock of what has transpired. I shall send for you when the police are ready to speak to you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Speak to me?&#x201d; My mother&#x2019;s eyes bugged. &#x201c;Speak to me? As if I would be involved in such a thing.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You saw Lord Montagu take his last breaths and collapse,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The police will need to hear your description of what happened.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I do not know why you are still standing here, Emily,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;If you believe there is some sort of criminal on the loose in the neighborhood who is going about murdering people, you ought to be ensuring the safety of your boys rather than embroiling yourself in an unsavory debacle utterly inappropriate for a lady. Children are always a mother&#x2019;s primary duty.&#x201d; <br>I took a deep breath and paused before replying. First and foremost, I knew I need not worry about the boys because they were in the hands of a most trustworthy nanny. Second, the idea that my mother, who had limited her involvement with her children up to the age of twelve to formal visits made once daily for not more than a quarter of an hour, would condemn me for relying on said nanny struck me as not a little hypocritical. I had always forgiven her neglect because she and my father had lost so many of their offspring to illness. I, the youngest, was the only one of seven to survive to adulthood. My mother had recovered from the death from influenza of my twin brothers, the only of my siblings I had ever known, by distancing herself even further from me until it was time to mold me into a sparkling debutante. &#x201c;Perhaps you could take care of that for me. Nanny should be put on alert.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I shall see to it at once,&#x201d; my mother said. &#x201c;Heaven knows someone in this household ought to be concerned about what matters, rather than getting distracted by the details of some ridiculous <i>alleged</i> crime.&#x201d; She marched out, slamming the door behind her. <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t think of less propitious circumstances in which to find ourselves. She could impede an investigation before having her first cup of tea in the morning.&#x201d; I sighed. &#x201c;One of us should go to Montagu and inform Matilda of what has happened.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Would you be so kind as to handle that?&#x201d; Colin asked. &#x201c;You are better acquainted with her than I. I shall have Flyte come down and inquire whether he heard anything and then deal with the police when they arrive.&#x201d; <br>I nodded. &#x201c;Of course. The police will doubtless respond better to you than to me. As for Matilda, I know all too well there is no good way to have this sort of conversation.&#x201d; <br>Matilda and I were not close friends, but our political beliefs, particularly those regarding suffrage, had thrown us together at meetings of the Women&#x2019;s Liberal Federation. We had worked to educate and enlighten the women in the district about their rights&#x2014;that is, the rights we both believed they should have&#x2014;and had organized several rallies on our estates. Our success could only be described as limited. While the women were captivated and energized, their husbands reacted to the issues with somewhat less enthusiasm. Through it all, our interactions had not escalated much beyond that of two business acquaintances. Nonetheless, it was appropriate that I, not my husband, speak to her about her cousin. <br>&#x201c;Shall I bring her back here?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;She has a house full of guests whom I imagine the police will want to interview. It might be nicer for her to be in somewhat quieter surroundings.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Quite,&#x201d; Colin said. &#x201c;She may also wish to see Scolfield.&#x201d; <br>I shuddered. Colin gave me a quick kiss, and I set off, dread consuming me. I would never grow comfortable with the task of informing someone of the violent death of a loved one. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Matilda Scolfield&#x2019;s grandfather, the previous Marquess of Montagu, had outlived Matilda&#x2019;s father, making her cousin Archibald next in line for the title. The old man had not seen fit to settle upon his heir the significant fortune he had amassed during his lifetime. Instead, he left his money, a house in London, two in Scotland, and a seaside cottage on the southern coast to his favorite granddaughter. The only part of his estate entailed was Montagu Manor itself, and that was all Archibald got. This had proved no hardship to him, as he stood to inherit a sizable sum from his parents and was already the recipient of a generous allowance. He was a capable young man, cheerful and eager, who had distinguished himself well enough at Oxford (knowing himself incapable of getting a first, he avoided the dreaded second and secured the third that perfectly reflected his academic ambitions) and now devoted much of his time to sport, earning a reputation as a fine rower. <i>Had devoted much of his time.</i> I reminded myself it was now necessary to use the past tense when referring to Archibald Scolfield. <br>A festive atmosphere still filled Montagu Manor when I arrived, no one inside knowing yet of its owner&#x2019;s demise.

The novel opens in northern Kenya with the gruesome murder of Tessa Quayle--young, beautiful, and dearly beloved to husband Justin. When Justin sets out on a personal odyssey to uncover the mystery of her death, what he finds could make him not only a suspect among his own colleagues, but a target for Tessa's killers as well. <br> <br> A master chronicler of the betrayals of ordinary people caught in political conflict, John le Carre portrays the dark side of unbridled capitalism as only he can. In <i>The Constant Gardener</i> he tells a compelling, complex story of a man elevated through tragedy as Justin Quayle--amateur gardener, aging widower, and ineffectual bureaucrat--discovers his own natural resources and the extraordinary courage of the woman he barely had time to love.</p><p>British diplomat Justin Quayle, complacent raiser of freesias and doting husband of the stunning, much younger Tessa, has tended his own garden in Nairobi too long. Tessa is Justin's opposite, a fiery reformer, "that rarest thing, a lawyer who believes in justice," whose campaigns have earned her a nickname: "the Princess Diana of the African poor." But now Tessa has turned up naked, raped, and dead on a mysterious visit to remote Lake Turkana in Kenya. Her traveling companion (and lover?), the handsome Congolese-Belgian doctor Arnold Bluhm, has vanished. So has Quayle's complacency. <p> Tessa had been compiling data against a multinational drug company that uses helpless Africans as guinea pigs to test a tuberculosis remedy with unfortunately fatal side effects. Her report was destroyed by her husband's superiors; was she? It's all somehow connected to the sinister British firm House of ThreeBees, whose ad boasts that it's "buzzy for the health of Africa!" John le Carr� symbolically associates ThreeBees with an ominous buzz in the Nairobi morgue: "Over [the corpses], in a swaying, muddy mist, hung the flies, snoring on a single note."</p><p> The home office tries to take Quayle in out of the cold. He cleverly eludes their clammy embrace, turns spy, and takes off on a global chase to avenge Tessa and solve her murder. Le Carr� has lost none of his gift for setting vivid scenes in far-flung places expertly described: London, Germany, Saskatchewan, Kenya. His sprinting thriller prose remains in great shape. And thanks to his 16 years in the British Foreign Office, his merciless send-up of its cutthroat intrigues and petty self-delusions is unbelievably good--or rather, believably so. This is global do-gooder satire on a literary par with Doris Lessing's <i>The Summer Before the Dark</i>.</p><p> But you want to know if <i>The Constant Gardener</i> is as good as <i>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</i>. Very nearly. Africa's nightmare is more complex than the cold war chess match, and the world pharmaceutical circus is tougher to dramatize than the old spy-versus-spy-versus-spymaster game. Still, le Carr� can write a smart, melancholy page-turner, and his moral outrage (the real subject of his books) burns as brightly as ever. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><b>John le Carr�</b> was born in 1931.

So along with his friends--Turtle, Iguana, and Potbellied Pig--he sets out to make the most magnificent strawberry shortcake in the whole wide world. But there&#x2019;s one problem: none of his friends knows how to cook! The team bravely forges ahead, and with Rooster&#x2019;s help, they learn how to measure flour (not with a ruler) and how to beat an egg (not with a baseball bat). But can they keep Pig from gobbling up all the ingredients? Take an old family recipe, add four funny friends, and mix in some hilarious cooking confusion and you have a picture book treat for children of all ages!<br></p><p><i>"'Always chicken feed! Day after day--year after year--I'm sick of it!' squawked Big Brown Rooster."</i> <p> In this deliciously imaginative book by sisters Janet Stevens and Susan Stevens Crummel, a hungry and fed-up rooster suddenly recalls his famous Great-Granny, a fabulous chef who penned a book of recipes for future generations. He hunts down her cookbook--<i>The Joy of Cooking Alone</i> by L.R. Hen. </p><p> </p><blockquote>Rooster carefully turned the pages. "So many recipes--and I thought she just baked bread! Look at the strawberry shortcake!... Yes sirree--just like Great-Granny, I'll be a cook! COOK-A-DOODLE-DO-O-O!"</blockquote><p> Upon settling down with this remarkable tale, every child's natural curiosity for cooking will likewise come bursting forth. There is a great basic story here, with plenty of creative spins on <i>The Little Red Hen</i>. In this version, Rooster--rebuffed by Dog, Cat, and Goose just like his Granny was--finds companionship in the kitchen with Turtle, Iguana, and Potbellied Pig. As Turtle reads the recipe aloud, Iguana continuously confuses the instructions to great comedic effect, <i>Amelia Bedelia</i>-style. (He tries to cut butter with scissors and beat an egg with a baseball bat.) Pig, on the other hoof, asks over and over for a chance to taste the batter. ("Looks mighty dry in there," said Pig. "Perhaps I should taste it.") Stevens's sure, friendly illustrations evoke a tremendous amount of character and activity in lightning-fast time. Take, for example, the cooking hats all the creatures don when they get to the kitchen: Turtle sports a copper-bottomed soup pot on his head, Iguana wields a candy-striped oven mitt, and Pig is wearing a kitchen towel, tied kerchief-style. They're ready!</p><p> Scattered through the story are sidebars with cooking tips that offer information on the ingredients, measurements, and techniques mentioned in the text. (Even if kids don't want to read them, they're quite handy for adults answering questions while reading.) Kids will love this lively, slapstick story of teamwork in action, and no doubt will want to try making strawberry shortcake! Fortunately, the recipe for "Great-Granny's Magnificent Strawberry Shortcake" is in the back.

The son of middle-class Norman parents, Becket rose against all odds to become the second most powerful man in England. As King Henry II&#x2019;s chancellor, Becket charmed potentates and popes, tamed overmighty barons, and even personally led knights into battle. After his royal patron elevated him to archbishop of Canterbury in 1162, however, Becket clashed with the King. Forced to choose between fealty to the crown and the values of his faith, he repeatedly challenged Henry&#x2019;s authority to bring the church to heel. Drawing on the full panoply of medieval sources, Guy sheds new light on the relationship between the two men, separates truth from centuries of mythmaking, and casts doubt on the long-held assumption that the headstrong rivals were once close friends. He also provides the fullest accounting yet for Becket&#x2019;s seemingly radical transformation from worldly bureaucrat to devout man of God.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here is a Becket seldom glimpsed in any previous biography, a man of many facets and faces: the skilled warrior as comfortable unhorsing an opponent in single combat as he was negotiating terms of surrender; the canny diplomat &#x201c;with the appetite of a wolf&#x201d; who unexpectedly became the spiritual paragon of the English church; and the ascetic rebel who waged a high-stakes contest of wills with one of the most volcanic monarchs of the Middle Ages. Driven into exile, derided by his enemies as an ungrateful upstart, Becket returned to Canterbury in the unlikeliest guise of all: as an avenging angel of God, wielding his power of excommunication like a sword. It is this last apparition, the one for which history remembers him best, that will lead to his martyrdom at the hands of the king&#x2019;s minions&#x2014;a grisly episode that Guy recounts in chilling and dramatic detail.<br> &nbsp;<br> An uncommonly intimate portrait of one of the medieval world&#x2019;s most magnetic figures, <i>Thomas Becket</i> breathes new life into its subject&#x2014;cementing for all time his place as an enduring icon of resistance to the abuse of power.<br><br><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY<br><i>Kansas City Star � </i>Bloomberg</b></p></p><p><b>John Guy</b> studied history at Clare College, Cambridge, and became a lecturer on early modern British history and Renaissance political thought.

The time was the afternoon of St. Thomas the Apostle&#x2019;s Day (December 21); the place a large house in Cheapside standing on the fief of the Marmion family, to whom a substantial annual quitrent was due.<br><br>Lying on the north side of Cheapside between Ironmonger Lane and Old Jewry, the Beckets&#x2019; house was within earshot of the busiest street market in London. Most likely it was built of wood and limestone with narrow, unglazed windows. Its main living areas were the open hall, or main reception area, warmed by a central stone hearth, with a private chamber to the side where the family lived, slept, and entertained their closest friends and relatives. The open hall was lit by wax tapers, was furnished with trestle tables and stools, and had washing bowls and basins suitably positioned by the door or in an alcove. Servants, who waited on the family and prepared their meals, slept in the hall. Beneath the house was an undercroft, or cellar, perhaps serving as a warehouse to store goods. Possibly the kitchen was at one end of the hall behind a wooden screen, maybe outside in an annex to minimize the risk of fire. Water for cooking and washing was drawn from a private well or purchased from one of the city&#x2019;s many water carriers, who scooped river water from the Thames into leather pouches, selling them door-to-door. Soap was generally made from ashes, and the Beckets cleaned their teeth using green hazel shoots before polishing them with woolen cloths.<br><br>While Gilbert and Matilda&#x2019;s open hall was apparently larger than average, their living chamber may have been fairly cramped. Working back from documents compiled in 1227&#x2013;28, it can be estimated that the property had a street frontage of 40 feet, a rear width of 110 feet, and a depth of 165 feet, but the greater portion of this area was taken up by a garden. The same documents show that the adjacent houses were approached via gatehouses and provided with outdoor latrines flowing into cesspits, so perhaps the Beckets&#x2019; house had such amenities too.<br><br>Baptized in the nearby parish church of St. Mary Colechurch, Thomas was named after the apostle whose festival it was. His godparents promised to protect him from &#x201c;fire and water and other perils&#x201d; until he was seven and teach him the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer, the Ave Maria (Hail Mary), and the Apostles&#x2019; Creed. Following time-hallowed rituals, the priest dipped Thomas in the font, then placed his thumb in holy oil, making the sign of the cross on the baby&#x2019;s forehead, shoulders, and chest, before wrapping him in a &#x201c;chrism cloth,&#x201d; a white linen christening robe, as a symbol of purity and to keep him warm.<br><br>Whereas baptism usually took place when a newborn child was a few days old, Thomas was brought to the church by a midwife or nurse within hours of his birth, suggesting he may have appeared weak or sickly, or perhaps his parents had lost an earlier child and were determined to make sure their son was christened at once. His father was present at the church but not his mother, since canon (or church) law forbade a newly delivered woman to enter a consecrated space until she had been ritually purified in a special ceremony some forty days after her lying-in.<br><br>Around the year 1110, Gilbert and Matilda Becket had joined settlers from Rouen, the chief city of the Norman dukes, who had flocked to London, enticed by the city&#x2019;s expanding trade. Most likely Gilbert was a draper&#x2019;s merchant, since Cheapside and its environs were inhabited mainly by goldsmiths and those dealing wholesale in textiles, and Gilbert is known not to have been a goldsmith. Although they came from Rouen, their exact birthplaces are disputed. William fitz Stephen (no relation to the skipper of the White Ship), also born to Norman parents in London and one of Thomas Becket&#x2019;s early biographers, says that Gilbert came from a fairly humble family living close to Thierville in the valley of the Risle, not far from Bec Abbey, some twenty-five miles from Rouen. An anonymous Canterbury monk says that Gilbert&#x2019;s family was from Rouen itself and that Matilda (who is sometimes called Rose) was most likely born and raised in Caen. Married at around the age of twenty, the couple immigrated to England soon after their wedding.<br><br>The surname Becket usually means &#x201c;little beak&#x201d; or &#x201c;beak-face,&#x201d; and young Thomas is known to have had an aquiline nose, probably inherited from his father. But it is far more likely that Becket derives from Bec, as in Bec Abbey. Surnames were optional in medieval society, and few people regularly used them. Gilbert and Matilda&#x2019;s eldest daughter, Agnes, was among them, calling herself Becket even after her marriage, but her brother never used the name, and when he is so addressed by others, it is usually derogatory. Before entering royal service, he preferred to call himself &#x201c;Thomas of London&#x201d; and afterward &#x201c;Thomas the chancellor&#x201d; or &#x201c;Thomas the archbishop.&#x201d; Just one chronicler, Roger of Howden, refers to him in the modern way, as Thomas Becket, and then only once.<br><br>One of the most enduring and tantalizingly romantic myths about Thomas is that his mother was a Saracen princess. Still often repeated as true, the story first became part of the Becket legend as the result of an interpolation in a corrupt medieval manuscript first printed at Paris in 1495. The same story appears in a chronicle attributed to John of Brompton, abbot of Jervaulx. Gilbert, it is said, had traveled on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem as a young man, attended only by a servant. While praying one day in a church, he was surprised by a party of Saracens, who abducted him and led him into slavery. Held for a year and a half, he suffered great hardships but slowly ingratiated himself with his captors, who allowed him to come to their table, where he explained to them the customs and manners of the Europeans. The Saracen lord&#x2019;s daughter took a fancy to him and secretly visited him in prison, offering to become a Christian if he would make her his bride. When a few months later he broke free from his chains and managed to escape in the company of some merchants, she followed him. Arriving in London alone and knowing no words in French or English besides &#x201c;London&#x201d; and &#x201c;Becket,&#x201d; she walked the streets desperately, mocked by bemused children, until by pure chance she was recognized by Gilbert&#x2019;s servant. Reluctant at first to marry her, but eager to see her baptized, Gilbert sought advice from the bishop of London, who, &#x201c;perceiving the hand of God visibly concerned in the affair,&#x201d; decided to baptize her the next day. After the ceremony at St. Paul&#x2019;s--conducted by six bishops--she and Gilbert were married, and Thomas was conceived overnight.<br><br>Edward Grim, once the rector of the parish of Saltwood in Kent, who went on to write one of Becket&#x2019;s early biographies, claims that Matilda Becket experienced a series of mystical visions around the time her son was born. Since he did not even know the family then, he was almost certainly using a hagiographer&#x2019;s trick to signal his subject&#x2019;s future greatness. In her first vision, Matilda is said to have felt the whole of the river Thames flowing within her. Seeking an explanation from soothsayers, she learned that &#x201c;the one who is born to you will rule over many people.&#x201d; Next she dreamed of going on a pilgrimage to Canterbury, but when she attempted to enter the cathedral, her womb swelled so large that she could not pass through the door. Her final vision concerned a blanket that magically and continually expanded. Seeing her baby lying uncovered in his cot, mother and nurse attempted to unravel the blanket, &#x201c;but they found the chamber too cramped for this purpose and the larger hall too, and even the street.&#x201d; Finally a voice from heaven thundered, &#x201c;All your efforts are useless. The whole of England is smaller than this purple cloth and cannot contain it.&#x201d;<br><br>When he was forty-six, Thomas would describe his parents as &#x201c;citizens of London, not by any means the lowest, living without dispute in the midst of their fellow citizens.&#x201d; Slights against his ancestry--of which he would receive many over the course of his eventful life--always stung him. &#x201c;I prefer,&#x201d; he would say, &#x201c;to be a man in whom nobility of mind creates nobility, rather than one in whom nobility of birth degenerates. Perhaps I was born in a humble cottage, but through the aid of divine mercy .&#x202f;.&#x202f;. I lived very well indeed in my poverty.&#x201d; And he would fearlessly defend his family&#x2019;s honor when he felt it unfairly impugned. &#x201c;What do family trees produce?&#x201d; he would ask. &#x201c;Which is more praiseworthy, to be born of middle-class or even more lowly stock, or to be born from the great and honored of the world, when St. Paul would say, &#x2018;Those parts of the body which we think less honorable we invest with the greater honor&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br>The description &#x201c;middle-class&#x201d; fits his parents perfectly. A prosperous London citizen, Gilbert was at best the son of a lesser knight or of a free agricultural tenant, but was at least a freeman&#x2019;s son at a time when the overwhelming majority of the Norman and English populations were tied laborers or peasants. Around thirty years old when Thomas was born, Gilbert would afterward rise to become one of the four sheriffs, or chief officers, of London. (The post of mayor did not yet exist.) The relationship between the Crown and city was close, and the sheriffs were its linchpins. William the Conqueror had relied on them to collect the city&#x2019;s annual &#x201c;farm,&#x201d; or tax, and to keep order. His son William Rufus had expected them to pay for knights, for repairs to London Bridge after it had been severely damaged by a flood, and for the costs of building his magnificent &#x201c;new hall&#x201d; at Westminster beside the abbey. Half a century would elapse before the Normans would feel wholly secure within the city, but King Henry I would regularly stay there. Most likely Gilbert ranked among the fifty or so leaders of London&#x2019;s civic elite.<br>Thomas Becket, who spent most of the first twenty-five years of his life in or around the city, was in many of his habits and values a Londoner even after he had left to make a career elsewhere. Proud of their adopted home, the Norman immigrant families of his parents&#x2019; generation had swiftly assimilated into civic society. With their underlying values of meritocracy and a self-governing community, Londoners believed passionately that they should be governed by themselves, remaining free to arrange things in their own interests and not in those of the lord who happened to own the land on which their houses were built. A rudimentary civic government and a representative assembly had existed since before the Conquest, when the citizens had gathered three times a year in the &#x201c;folkmoot&#x201d; to regulate their own affairs. So Londoners had a long-established tradition of self-government.<br><br>Early in his reign, William the Conqueror had confirmed these freedoms, which included the right to punish offenses committed on market days and to enforce the bargains made. The citizens then purchased a much amplified charter from Henry I, allowing them to elect their own sheriffs and hear lawsuits in their own civic courts. To improve their trade, they secured exemption from the tolls and customs duties imposed on them by other English cities or seaports. And to encourage their cooperation with the Crown, the king agreed to reduce their annual tax, while the royal family showed its generosity in other ways. Shortly before Thomas was born, Henry&#x2019;s first wife, Queen Matilda, had founded a new public bathhouse and latrine complex in the city, together with a leper hospital outside the walls.<br><br>Thriving chiefly on its commerce, London was a trading city and a major seaport. Ships could navigate the Thames as far as London Bridge, where cargoes traveling farther upstream had to be unloaded and transferred to smaller vessels on the other side of the bridge. Wharves and landings (or stairs) were scattered along the banks of the river, since each &#x201c;lord&#x201d; and district had their own. Wherries and ferryboats shuttled people, horses, fish, grain, and every type of merchandise from one bank to the other. Regulating trade themselves, the citizens had made sure, since 984&#x2013;85 in the reign of King �thelred, that ships landing fish at London Bridge would be expected to pay a toll. Within a century, merchants from Normandy and France, Flanders, Italy and Germany, Gascony, and the Mediterranean would be flocking to London, where they were required to display their wares to the customs officials on arrival and pay tolls on the wharf or on board their ships.<br><br>Increasingly the hub of a national network supplying food and commodities, London took advantage of a transport system based on ancient river routes and the old Roman roads. These roads, though full of potholes and poorly maintained, were adequate for sledges, carts, or wagons drawn by oxen or packhorses. Heavier loads were more suited to the river routes, which chiefly ran north along the Lea deep into leafy Hertfordshire; upstream along the Thames into Berkshire and Oxfordshire; or downstream along the coasts of Essex and Kent, and then onward by sea to the ports of East Anglia and Lincolnshire, and north toward Newcastle and Scotland.<br><br>Occupying an area slightly more than three hundred acres, the city looked very much like an irregular half ellipse nestled on the Thames, enclosed on the northern, or land, side by the old Roman walls but occasionally spilling outside, mainly to the south and west, into Middlesex and Surrey to create the suburbs of Southwark and Westminster. Although the old Roman walls had become dilapidated, with many gaps and holes, the core remained largely intact except along the riverbank, where everything had collapsed into the mud. Accordingly, access by road was through one of seven gateways, which were surmounted by lofty towers, or keeps, regularly used as prisons. Locked and barred at night to keep out thieves, four of the gates had a central opening for carts, with a passage for those on foot on either side, leaving three for pedestrians only.<br><br>The original Roman bridge had crossed the Thames near Fish Street Hill, the lowest point at which such a wide and fast-flowing tidal stream could be spanned. Its pre-Conquest replacement, built of timber and broad enough for two wagons to pass each other, was still standing in Thomas Becket&#x2019;s lifetime, though in constant need of repairs. Always the key point of entry to the city from Southwark and the south bank, this bridge played a crucial role in London&#x2019;s economy and defenses, for it would take another fifty years to get a project for a new stone bridge off the ground.</p><h2>Outlaws of Mesquite Lamour Collec</h2><p>Leatherette cover, Pages and binding tight.

He&#39;s a native of China who teaches workshops around the world, as well as watercolor and sketching classes at U.C. Berkeley. He lives in Pinole, CaliforniaZhen notes in his introduction that Chinese artists refer not to painting but to writing as they pare down to the essentials and capture the essence and spirit of a creature rather than merely copy its nature. He traces the development of Chinese animal painting from the realism of the Tang Dynasty 1,300 years ago to the more spontaneous, abstract contemporary style, comparing and correlating that to the simplification of written Chinese over time. He then introduces materials and basic techniques, comparing Chinese and Western watercolor papers, brushes, and paints. His detailed descriptions and full-color examples of similarities and differences extend throughout, with discussions of styles, arrangements of materials, brush techniques, and more. Zhen emphasizes dynamic movement within compositions before progressing to details. Actual step-by-step instructions in the final section include exercises featuring squirrels, monkeys, and tigers and complete compositions involving elephants, turtles, and birds. This amply illustrated how-to gracefully bridges the gap between East and West and should draw fans of both approaches. <i>Whitney Scott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

First published in 1957 to critical and popular acclaim, his book has become a cult favorite in intelligence circles. The story follows Hall&#39;s experiences from a junior officer fleeing a tedious training assignment in Louisiana to his quirky and rigorous OSS training rituals in the United States, England, and Scotland. Quick to pick up on the skills necessary for behind-the-lines intelligence work, he became an expert instructor. But he was only reluctantly given operational duties because of his reputation as an iconoclast. In his droll story-telling style, Hall describes his first parachute jump in support of the French resistance as a comedy of errors that terminated prematurely. His last assignment in the war zone came when William Colby appointed him section head of an operations group that made its way on foot through Sweden.

Chances are you weren&#x2019;t successful in shifting that person&#x2019;s beliefs in a significant way. For an endeavor so commonly mentioned and frequently attempted, why is the phenomenon of changing minds so mysterious? How do people become set on a certain way of thinking? And what, exactly, does it take to change that perspective? </p><p>In this groundbreaking book, world-renowned Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner offers surprising insights on this fascinating puzzle&#x2014;insights that could change the way we interact with others at work, at home, and in every aspect of our lives. Gardner, whose work over the last thirty years has revolutionized our thinking about intelligence, creativity, and leadership, now suggests that traditional thinking about mind change as a sudden "epiphany" is entirely wrong. Instead, Gardner shows, we change our minds gradually, in identifiable ways that can be actively and powerfully influenced. </p><p>Drawing on decades of cognitive research, Gardner identifies seven levers that aid or thwart the process of mind change, including reason, research, real-world events, and resistances. Changing Minds provides an original framework&#x2014;illustrated with famous and ordinary examples of "change agents" in politics, business, science, the arts, and everyday life&#x2014;that shows how individuals can align these levers to bring about significant changes in perspective and behavior. From Margaret Thatcher&#x2019;s reorientation of Great Britain to Sir John Browne&#x2019;s transformation of BP to Charles Darwin&#x2019;s evolutionary revolution to interactions between spouses or friends to decisions to change one&#x2019;s own mind, Gardner uncovers surprising similarities and instructive differences among the factors that affect mind change in a variety of settings. </p><p>Demystifying a phenomenon that permeates human behavior, Changing Minds provides insights that can broaden our horizons and improve our lives.</p>&#x201c;One of the leading psychologists of our times has taken on the single deepest question in the field: How and when do we change our minds?

She's addicted to the night. Addicted to shiny objects. Addicted to Batman. Most of all, Catwoman is addicted to danger. She can't help herself, and the truth is&#x2013;she doesn't want to. She's good at being bad, and very bad at being good.<p>But this time, Selina steals from the wrong man, and now he's got her. He wants his stuff back, he wants answers and he wants blood.

Like being given the keys to a spaceship. We were all given the opportunity to go ANYWHERE with the characters. So, we all just strapped in and held on tight.</p> <p><strong> Q:</strong> How are you balancing making these stories and characters feel fresh and new while still respecting what came before?</p> <p><strong> JW:</strong> It was about making the characters feel present. To tap an old clich�, we are "...standing on the shoulders of giants." There's a reason these characters have been around for so long--they're so rich and strong that they stand the test of time. Our job is to make them a part of the modern world.</p> <p><strong> Q:</strong> What would you say defines the character you are working on?</p> <p><strong> JW:</strong> Catwoman is a criminal, but she's not a villain. She steals, she breaks the law, but she's got a very specific moral code that drives her. She is by no means a hero. That makes her very different from most of the leads in other books. And, y'know, she's sexy as all heck.</p> <p><strong> Q:</strong> What have you thought about the response so far for The New 52 and your title(s) as a whole?</p> <p><strong> JW:</strong> With <em>Catwoman</em> we have piqued interests, stirred up trouble, surprised, outraged, drawn people in, and turned the tables on them again. Just like Catwoman would do. </p> <p><strong> Q:</strong> What do you think makes the character of Selina Kyle so appealing? Why is she such an integral part of the Batman mythos?</p> <p><strong> JW:</strong> Catwoman is the ultimate bad girl. A historic bad girl. She has always represented many layers of trouble for Batman. He's drawn to her, he knows that he should stop her, but ...he can't bring himself to do it. Batman sees himself as an unemotional beast driven by his mission. But there's this woman in the cat suit that just knocks him off his game. And I think part of him likes it.</p>A former cast member on MTV's The Real World, Judd Winick is the writer and illustrator of&nbsp;<i>Barry Ween&#x2014;Boy Genius</i>&nbsp;and the Pulitzer Prize-nominated Pedro and Me.

A summer job as companion to weird old Mrs. Cottler (who lives on Fear Street) becomes upsetting to Mayra, and she begins to sleepwalk at night after having nightmares. The job really becomes frightening when Mayra's best friend is mistaken for her and is nearly killed in an automobile accident.

Nancy and Lawrence Goldstone's romance with rare books arose from just such a search and led them to a world they had never encountered before: the world of antiquarian books. They quickly found themselves infatuated with this quaint and curious world, and scoured the East Coast in search of first editions and rare books. This search, and the curious people they met along the way, is chronicled in their book Used and Rare. Their second book, <i>Slightly Chipped</i>, continues this exploration, taking us on tours of book fairs, libraries, and auctions. No longer the wide-eyed innocents, the Goldstones delve a little deeper into the book world: they explore facets such as fine printing and literary movements, pour over Bram Stoker's notes for <i>Dracula</i>, and puzzle over the incredible markup of hypermoderns. (Never heard of hypermoderns? They are collectible books recently published. A first edition of Sue Grafton's <i>A Is for Alibi</i> sold for $1,250 in 1998. Better check your shelves.)<p> Both the avid bibliophile and the casual reader will find things to enjoy in <i>Slightly Chipped</i>. For the collector, the Goldstones' discussion of the Internet's impact on collecting is illuminating, and their look at the hypermodern market is positively eye-opening. Plus, visits to such places as the Rosenbach Museum in Philadelphia and the Pequot Library in Connecticut will get any bibliophile's salivary glands going. For the casual reader, <i>Slightly Chipped</i> is as warm and engaging as <i>Used and Rare</i>; although the Goldstones have become sophisticated book collectors, there is still plenty of the ingenuous surprise and delight that made <i>Used and Rare</i> such a joy to read. They balance out the serious aspects of book collecting with a liberal peppering of literary anecdotes, ranging from William Morris's tyrannical leadership of the Kelmscott Press to the sexual proclivities of Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group, keeping the tone light and the pace lively. All this packed into one volume makes <i>Slightly Chipped</i> a rare treat for book lovers of all types. <i>--Perry Atterberry</i></p><b>Lawrence </b>and <b>Nancy Goldstone </b>are the authors of <i>Used and Rare. </i>They are currently at work on <i>Warmly Inscribed, </i>the third in the series.

They make their home in Southern California.<b>Why Every Marriage Gets Stuck</b><br><br>If we all naturally knew <i>how </i>to love, this book would be unnecessary, and Milan and I would each be out of a job as counselors. All of us who have been married more than a few years will admit it is a bit more challenging than we anticipated on our wedding day. Every marriage has nagging problems calling for our attention. Many people end up thinking their relationship is difficult because they married the wrong person. But the fact that many people are on to their second and third marriages proves that no marriage is tension free. Sometimes our marriages seem to run fairly smoothly&#x2014;until we hit a crisis or face difficult circumstances. Stress always makes underlying problems more apparent.<br>Over the years many couples have come to us for help with their problems. We routinely ask several questions no matter what situation they describe. Recently, for instance, Hannah and Robert came in for their initial session. I asked them what Milan and I ask all the couples we see in our offices: &#x201c;Tell me about the chronic irritations in your relationship. Perhaps it&#x2019;s the same old fight that never gets resolved. Maybe it&#x2019;s a pattern of relating that occurs again and again. Where do you get stuck?&#x201d;<br>Hannah looked at Robert, and they laughed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s easy,&#x201d; she smiled. &#x201c;It happened in the car on the drive to your office. I&#x2019;m always the one bringing up the problems, so Robert is always telling me I am controlling. I was mad at him because he didn&#x2019;t know what he wanted to talk about in our counseling session. He&#x2019;s too passive. I want him to initiate more and try harder.&#x201d; Robert chimed in, &#x201c;I do try. It&#x2019;s just never enough for you, Hannah.&#x201d; Hannah looked at me. &#x201c;See? Now he will pout and withdraw, and nothing<br>will get resolved.&#x201d; I summarized, &#x201c;So no matter what problem you want to discuss, this is your same old dance, the pattern that happens over and over. Is that correct?&#x201d;<br>Robert and Hannah both nodded. They had pinpointed their core pattern. Some couples who are just dating can already describe their core pattern. A core pattern is the predicable way you and your spouse react to each other that leaves each of you frustrated and dissatisfied. Some are married a few years before it is apparent but sooner or later couples can readily identify the same old place when they get stuck. Maybe it&#x2019;s the same complaints that come up again and again without every getting resolved or a familiar pattern of fighting, no matter what the topic. Milan and I are no different. We were married in 1972, and by 1976 we had discovered the classic scene that would play itself out over and over for ten more years of our marriage.<br>We had just put the kids to bed and collapsed on the couch. I picked up a magazine and began to thumb through it, and Milan sat quietly watching me. This was a familiar feeling; I knew he was taking my emotional temperature. I was hoping he would pick up the remote and turn on the television.<br>&#x201c;How are you doing? Did you have a good day?&#x201d; he asked.<br>I could feel myself getting annoyed. &#x201c;Why do you keep asking me that? You already asked me that question two times since you came home from work. It&#x2019;s the same answer: I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;<br>We were starting the wearisome dance that would send us both to bed angry and frustrated. I tried to derail the invitation. &#x201c;I think there is a game on TV tonight.&#x201d;<br>Milan was undeterred. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re fine, then why did it bother you when I hugged and kissed you when I came home from work? I&#x2019;m happy to see you, and you act like it&#x2019;s a chore to give me a little affection. You have been distant all evening. What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br>I sighed. <i>I wish you would go away and let me read my magazine, </i>I thought. For some reason, I began to explain, knowing it wouldn&#x2019;t help. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had kids hanging on me all day. When you got home, I was in the middle of cooking dinner and supervising homework, and you want me to drop everything. Why do you always have to make such a big deal?&#x201d; The next steps of the dance were predictable.<br>Milan would give me examples of my lack of affection and attentiveness, and I would tell him he was too needy and made me feel smothered. If you have been married for a few years, you can probably describe your own recurring fight, the discussion you&#x2019;ve had over and over that never gets resolved. You can probably also describe the ways you avoid dealing with problems, and they may be some of the same lines we hear in our offices every day.<br>� &#x201c;I try hard to make you happy, but you are never satisfied.&#x201d;<br>� &#x201c;I feel like I&#x2019;m walking on eggshells with you.&#x201d;<br>� &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve told you over and over what I need, and you just won&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d;<br>� &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t you be more spontaneous and passionate?&#x201d;<br>� &#x201c;If you would listen and do what I ask, I wouldn&#x2019;t be angry.&#x201d;<br>� &#x201c;I&#x2019;m happy with the way things are. You&#x2019;re the one who is always bringing up problems.&#x201d;<br>� &#x201c;You say you&#x2019;re sorry, but nothing changes.&#x201d;<br>Are any of these steps in your same old dance? Maybe, like us, you find yourself locked in the same tiring dance over and over. Maybe you&#x2019;ve tried to change your marriage and have been disappointed with the results. Much marriage advice focuses on treating symptoms and surface issues. You think, <i>If it were possible to simply stop certain behaviors and do something different, it would be that easy. </i>But trying to change the things on the surface misses the underlying issues. Occasionally, the adjustment brings good results, and the annoying problem dies down. But it always comes back because there are source patterns guiding those bumbling steps, and until you address them, the dance won&#x2019;t get any<br>better.<br>Marriage is the most challenging relationship you will ever have, and to think otherwise is to live in denial. When you are with someone day in and day out, you can&#x2019;t hide. Your weaknesses become quite visible, and old feelings from the distant past are stirred. The close proximity of our mates triggers old feelings as we look to them to meet many of the needs our parents were originally supposed to meet. Milan and I spent the first fourteen years of our marriage trying to change our destructive pattern, but we were only addressing the obvious issues that constantly surfaced. We listed the problems and searched for solutions. After fourteen years, though, a huge change took place when we discovered the unseen forces that determined <i>how we loved. </i>We realized our lessons in love didn&#x2019;t start in marriage. They started in infancy and lasted for all the years we lived with our parents. Our experiences growing up, good and bad, left a lasting imprint in our souls that determined our beliefs and expectations about how to give love and receive love. Milan and I had different lessons about love, which resulted in different imprints, and without realizing it, we were dancing to different tunes. No wonder we were stepping on each other&#x2019;s toes. Lasting change became possible when we made that revolutionary discovery.<br><br><b>THE REVOLUTIONARY TRUTH<br><br></b>What are these imprints&#x2014;these earlier dance lessons that healthy or not form our beliefs and expectations about love? All of us have an imprint of intimacy, the sum of our learning about how to love.1 Our imprint determines our love style&#x2014;how we interact with others when it comes to love. For a few of us, our early love lessons were ideal, and our love style is healthy and positive. Most of us had some hurtful experiences resulting in a harmful imprint and impaired love style. Have you every considered the unseen forces governing how you love? Like Milan and me, you will most likely identify with one of five, common, ineffective love styles resulting from less than ideal imprints. I first learned how definable these love styles were when I was in graduate school. I had a wonderful supervisor and mentor named Dae Leckie. She taught me the importance of our first lessons about love and introduced me to attachment theory.2 I was amazed to easily identify my own love style as well as Milan&#x2019;s.<br>For the first time I could see how our different styles collided and were at the root of the destructive core pattern that had frustrated us for fourteen years. This new knowledge provided the most profound revelations about how we loved&#x2014;and why it wasn&#x2019;t working.<br><br>Milan: Being cautious about some aspects of psychology, I found it interesting to see that in the New Testament the Greek word for &#x201c;soul&#x201d; is <i>psuche, </i>which means &#x201c;inner person&#x201d; in its broadest sense.3 The word <i>psychology </i>uses the same Greek root and literally means &#x201c;the study of the soul,&#x201d; giving rise to our concept of the spiritual that resides within. Attachment theory, simply put, is based on a child&#x2019;s bond with his or her primary caregiver. God designed us to need connection, and our relationships with our parents is the first place this happens&#x2014;or doesn&#x2019;t happen. Attachment theory outlines specifically what can go wrong and looks at how our ability to love is shaped by our first experiences with our parents and caregivers during our early years<i>. These early experiences leave a lasting imprint on our souls that is still observable in our adult relationships.</i>4 Kay: Of course, none of us are shaped perfectly during our formative years. Our world is less than ideal, and our ability to love is marred as a result. Attachment theory helps us recognize this by simply describing observable behavioral patterns, some that are helpful and some that are harmful when it comes to forming healthy, loving relationships. Milan and I had no idea what was driving us to respond to each other in the damaging ways we were. A...</p><h2>Beautiful Room Is Empty</h2><p>When the narrator of White's poised yet scalding autobiographical novel first embarks on his sexual odyssey, it is the 1950s, and America is "a big gray country of families on drowsy holiday." That country has no room for a scholarly teenager with guilty but insatiable stirrings toward other men. Moving from a Midwestern college to the Stonewall Tavern on the night of the first gay uprising--and populated by eloquent queens, butch poseurs, and a fearfully incompetent shrink--<b>The Beautiful Room is Empty</b> conflates the acts of coming out and coming of age.<br><br>"With intelligence, candor, humor--and anger--White explores the most insidious aspects of oppression.... An impressive novel."--<i>Washington Post book World</i><br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p><b>Edmund White </b>was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1940. His fiction includes the autobiographical trilogy&nbsp;<i>A Boy<i>&#x2019;s</i> Own Story</i>, <i>The Beautiful Room Is Empty</i>,&nbsp;and<b>&nbsp;</b><i>The Farewell Symphony</i>, as well as<i>&nbsp;Caracole</i>, <i>Forgetting Elena</i>,<i> Nocturnes for the King of Naples</i>,&nbsp;and<b>&nbsp;</b><i>Skinned Alive</i>, a collection of short stories. He is also the author of a highly acclaimed biography of Jean Genet, a short study of Proust, a travel book about gay America&#x2014;<i>States of Desire</i>&#x2014;and&nbsp;<i>Our Paris</i>. He is an officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and teaches at Princeton University. He lives in New York City.This sequel to A Boy's Own Story is a satisfying successor to that acclaimed 1982 novel, taking the narrator through the 1950s and '60s as he matures as a gay man at the University of Michigan and later in New York. Some of White's previous fiction (Forgetting Elena, Caracole) has been considered opaque and inaccessible, but his discursive stylea modified stream of consciousness that leans luxuriantly and effectively on metaphor and simileaptly suits A Boy's Own Story and this novel, both books of memory, never too tightly plotted, but always revelatory of character and milieu as a wise narrator dissects his past and the web of his relationships with family, lovers and friends. Life in the novel is life as it is remembered, and the two novels form the lyrical but politically pointed fictional autobiography of a homosexual recalling his youth (in A Boy's Own Story) and, in this novel, the last years of psychological self-oppression and the first sweet years of liberation. White's gift for dialogue and anecdote and the melancholy elegance of his prose (often at odds with the spiteful tone the narrator takes) persuade the reader to suspend judgment as the author suspends time, to move with the narrator back and forth between past and deeper past, to delve deeper inside the soul of a man whose spiritual and sexual odysseys chart the development and joyfully confirm the existence of the elusive notion of "gay sensibility." <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Saul Leiter: Early Black and White</h2><p>The distinctive iconography of Saul Leiter's early black-and-white photographs stems from his profound response to the dynamic street life of New York City in the late 1940s and 50s.

Like a Magic Realist with a camera, Leiter absorbed the mystery of the city and poignant human experiences.

Prophets, apostles and Jesus himself took up this image from David, reshaping it, developing it and applying it to their own situations and needs. Kenneth Bailey uses his celebrated insights into Middle Eastern culture and especially his familiarity with Middle Eastern shepherding customs to bring new light and life to our understanding of this central image of the Christian faith. With each of nine major Old and New Testament passages, Bailey reveals the literary artistry of the Biblical writers and summarizes their key theological features. His work is also enriched by his unique access to very early Middle Eastern commentaries on these passages, bringing fresh understanding from within the mindset of these ancient worlds. <em>The Good Shepherd</em> invites us to experience a rich, biblical feast of ethical, theological and artistic delights.</p><p>Kenneth E. Bailey (ThD, Concordia Theological Seminary) is an author and lecturer in Middle Eastern New Testament studies. He spent forty years living and teaching New Testament in Egypt, Lebanon, Jerusalem and Cyprus. Bailey has written many books in English and Arabic, including <em>The Cross and the Prodigal</em> and <em>Jesus Through Middle Eastern Eyes</em> ."Psalm 23 and its theme of the Good Shepherd have long captivated the minds of Christian authors. In this book Bailey demonstrates that there is a close connection between the theme of God's Shepherd as depicted in Psalm 23 and other texts in the Bible. Bailey's approach is accessible, avoiding technical and overly specialized language. The fact that Bailey draws attention to the Arabic heritage of Christian literature on this topic is most welcome. The volume will prove to be stimulating devotional reading and a useful tool for preaching." (Silviu Tatu, Themelios, Vol. 40, Issue 2, August 2015)<br><br>"Deftly wielding the tools of biblical scholarship, story-telling and cultural exegesis, Ken Bailey has restored to its full color and brilliance one of the most magnificent images of Scripture&#x2015;the character and work of the Good Shepherd. This book is a treasure trove of useable insights for preachers and teachers and a devotional classic for daily disciples alike." (Daniel Meyer, Christ Church, Oakbrook, Illinois)<br><br>"'You prepare a table before me . . . my cup overflows.' What a feast Ken Bailey has prepared for us in this book, and what an overflowing cupful of insights and illumination. If you ever thought there was nothing more you could ever learn or preach about the biblical image of the good shepherd, this book has an abundance of surprises. Again and again I thought, 'Why have I never seen that before?'&#x2015;as Ken draws on his rich lifetime's experience of Middle Eastern culture to explore biblical texts, and particularly when he shows eye-opening connections between Old and New Testament texts around the shepherd theme. This is a book that simultaneously brings the Bible to life, and exalts the Lord Jesus Christ by deeply enriching our understanding of his mission and claims as the Good Shepherd." (Christopher J. H. Wright, International Ministries Director, Langham Partnership)<br><br>"Bailey presents a cumulative comparison of these passages as he progresses, drawing insights from books and articles written by Middle Eastern shepherds and from commentaries and Bible translations in Arabic, Syriac, and Armenian. <em>The Good Shepherd</em> is appropriate for pastors, seminary students, and other serious students of the Bible." (Daniel Johnson, CBA Retailers + Resources, January 2015)<br><br>"Ken Bailey is the consummate expert on the cultural context of first-century life. And here he applies these skills to one motif&#x2015;the shepherd&#x2015;illustrating how it is employed in a variety of biblical stories and parables. His interpretations use a variety of tools unknown to many of us: ancient versions, original languages, cultural anthropology, ancient Middle Eastern writers who shared this ancient culture, and his own personal career embedded in a crosscultural life in the Middle East. Always insightful, always fresh, consistently surprising, Bailey has produced yet another book that will get many of us rethinking beloved passages of Scripture in completely new ways." (Gary Burge, Wheaton College)<br><br>"Kenneth Bailey refreshes the souls of readers with deep textual insights and helpful contextual background to safely shepherd readers through the thousand-year story of Psalm 23. He makes several stops along the way in the Prophets, before settling into the Gospels where he deftly introduces us to a fresh understanding of the Good Shepherd. Anyone who loves the 23rd Psalm will love this book." (David Lamb, associate professor of Old Testament, Biblical Theological Seminary; author of God Behaving Badly)<br><br>"'The Lord is my shepherd.' There is no more beloved picture of God's relationship with his people. Jesus' declaration that he is 'the good shepherd' has comforted Christians for centuries. Using his impressive knowledge of Scripture and his experience living for many years in the Middle East, Bailey deepens and enriches our understanding of what it means to be members of God�s flock." (Tremper Longman III, Robert H. Gundry Professor of Biblical Studies, Westmont College)<br><br>"I enjoyed <em>The Good Shepherd</em> immensely. His point is handily established: Psalm 23 and the good shepherd tradition is an important literary and theological lens for interpreting the New Testament writers' presentation of Jesus and for our conceiving of our calling as Christian leaders. I highly recommend it for every pastor's shelf." (Andrew Sargent, Criswell Theological Review, Fall 2015)<br><br>"The balance of literary analysis and sociohistorical insight provides readers with new eyes to see; what was familiar becomes novel. This is a valuable addition to seminary and personal libraries alike." (Brittany Hale, Religious Studies Review, 41:4, December, 2015)<br><br>"This book will work for a variety of audiences, from undergraduate students to professional scholars.

Discover the secret Culper Ring, a network of American spies fighting against the British redcoats. Meet historical figures like George Washington and the soon-to-be-infamous Benedict Arnold. And meet Anna Strong, an unsung heroine who found ingenious ways to communicate top-secret messages to her fellow spies&#x2014;helping to free the American colonies from British rule.<br> &nbsp;<br> Your mission: Decode Anna Strong&#x2019;s hidden message and discover the secret assignment she undertook for the Culper Ring. There are clues embedded in the book&#x2019;s text and illustrations, plus spycraft materials, including a cipher wheel, in an envelope at the beginning of the book.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Enigma Alberti is the nom de plume of a secret cadre of authors who are each writing a book in the <i>Spy on History</i> series.Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;This new title in the series introduces young readers to the American Revolution, the Culper Spy Ring, and one of its intrepid but little-known members, Anna Strong. In the village of Setauket on New York's Long Island Sound, British soldiers lived among local residents, often harassing them and forcibly taking what they wanted. Wary but defiant, a small group of trusted acquaintances formed the Culper Spy Ring, devised a numeric code for communicating vital information about British military plans, and secretly delivered their intelligence to General George Washington. After her outspoken husband was imprisoned on a British ship, Strong sent their older children to safety in Connecticut while she stayed in Setauket to protect their family property. From her "house at a high point on the coast," she signaled meeting times and locations to fellow spies using her laundry&#x2014;a black petticoat and six handkerchiefs. Feisty and quick-witted, Strong also prepared large merchandise lists that required regular trips into New York City for intelligence gathering. Thanks to Strong and the Culper Ring, a British attack on the arriving, supportive French fleet was averted, and the treasonous plan of General Benedict Arnold was revealed. Lively text, a mix of font styles, and black-and-white illustrations enhance readability. Adding further appeal, this interactive book includes embedded clues and codes along with spycraft tools to help readers decode a final, secret message from Anna. A helpful historical note and a brief bibliography are appended. VERDICT Young readers will admire Anna Strong's resourceful and courageous efforts to help the Patriot cause. In addition, readers will gain insight on multiple Revolutionary War issues: Loyalist and Patriot viewpoints on independence, the oppressive proximity of British soldiers in local communities, and George Washington's desperate need for secure, timely intelligence.

He often came across as a man possessed, holding forth on culture and politics while mixing in personal revelations &#x2013; all with mercurial, tongue-twisting intensity as he inhabited and shed one character after another with lightning speed. </p><p>But as Dave Itzkoff shows in this revelatory biography, Williams&#x2019;s comic brilliance masked a deep well of conflicting emotions and self-doubt, which he drew upon in his comedy and in celebrated films like <i>Dead Poets Society</i>; <i>Good Morning, Vietnam</i>; <i>The Fisher King</i>; <i>Aladdin</i>; and <i>Mrs. Doubtfire</i>, where he showcased his limitless gift for improvisation to bring to life a wide range of characters. And in <i>Good Will Hunting </i>he gave an intense and controlled performance that revealed the true range of his talent.</p><p>Itzkoff also shows how Williams struggled mightily with addiction and depression &#x2013; topics he discussed openly while performing and during interviews &#x2013; and with a debilitating condition at the end of his life that affected him in ways his fans never knew. Drawing on more than a hundred original interviews with family, friends, and colleagues, as well as extensive archival research, <i>Robin</i> is a fresh and original look at a man whose work touched so many lives.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of May 2018:</strong> David Itzkoff&#x2019;s monument of a biography is an intimate and thorough examination of Robin Williams as both man and performer. From his years as a reclusive kid playing up in his attic bedroom, to his early days of standup, to the runaway success of Mork and Mindy, to movies, addiction, recovery, and fame, his need for affirmation was the thread that drew him forward. He sought that affirmation by working tirelessly, and Itzkoff chronicles the actor&#x2019;s successes and failures, as well as his close friendships in and out of show business, to create a deep psychological portrait. Robin Williams possessed an earnestness and a craving for honesty that made him shine brighter even as it threatened to destroy him. This is a bittersweet read, with highs and lows, but the Robin Williams who emerges is as compelling as his greatest performances. -- <em>Chris Schluep</em><b>Dave Itzkoff</b> is the author of <i>M</i><i>ad as Hell, Cocaine&#x2019;s Son</i>, and <i>Lads</i>.

The truth is, I believe everything he says. And he has a nice big nose for a human. But what&#x2019;s that saying? Not much.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a fact that trouble has a smell&#x2014;human trouble especially, sour and penetrating&#x2014;but Bernie had never smelled trouble before, or if so he hadn&#x2019;t mentioned it, and Bernie mentioned all kinds of things to me. We&#x2019;re partners in the Little Detective Agency, me and Bernie, Bernie&#x2019;s last name being Little. I&#x2019;m Chet, pure and simple.<br> <br>I took a quick sniff, smelled no trouble whatsoever, just as I&#x2019;d expected, but did smell lots of other stuff, including burgers cooking on a grill. I looked around: no grill in sight, and this wasn&#x2019;t the time to go searching, although all at once I was a bit hungry, maybe even more than a bit. We were on the job, trailing some woman whose name I&#x2019;d forgotten. She&#x2019;d led us out of the Valley to a motel in a flea-bitten desert town. That was what Bernie called it&#x2014;flea-bitten&#x2014;but I felt no fleas at all, hadn&#x2019;t been bothered by them in ages, not since I started on the drops. But the funny thing was, even though I didn&#x2019;t have fleas, just the thought of them suddenly made me itchy. I started scratching, first behind my ear, soon along my side, then both at once, really digging in with my claws, faster and&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Chet, for God&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d;<br> <br>I went still, one of my back paws frozen in midair. Bernie gave me a close look. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me I forgot the drops?&#x201d; I gave him a close look right back. Bernie has these faint lines on his forehead. When he worries, they get deeper, like now. I don&#x2019;t like it when Bernie worries. I pushed all thoughts about scratching clear out of my mind and sat straight up in the shotgun seat&#x2014;my very favorite spot&#x2014;alert and flealess.<br> <br>We were in the Porsche. There are fancy Porsches out there&#x2014;we see them on the freeways; we&#x2019;ve got freeways out the yingyang in the Valley&#x2014;but ours isn&#x2019;t one of them. It&#x2019;s very old, brown with yellow doors, and there&#x2019;s a bullet hole in the back license plate. How that happened is a story for another time.<br> <br>There was one palm tree on the street in front of the motel, a small one with dusty leaves, and we were parked behind it. That was part of our stakeout technique, hiding behind trees. Maybe it was our whole technique: I couldn&#x2019;t think of any other parts at the moment. Beyond the palm tree stood the motel, horseshoe-shaped&#x2014;just one of the many strange things about horses, that they wore shoes&#x2014;with parking in between. Two cars in the lot, parked far from each other. One, a red convertible, belonged to the woman we were tailing. The other, a dark sedan, had been there when we arrived.<br> <br>We gazed at the motel door closest to the red convertible. The woman&#x2014;short, blond, curvy&#x2014;had jumped out of the car and gone straight inside. Since then&#x2014;nothing. That was one of the problems with divorce work: no action. We hated divorce work, me and Bernie&#x2014;our specialty was missing persons&#x2014;but with the state of our finances we couldn&#x2019;t turn down anything. How our finances got this way is a long story, hard to keep straight in my head. Early on, there&#x2019;d been the Hawaiian pants. Bernie loves Hawaiian shirts&#x2014;right now he was wearing the one with the trumpet pattern&#x2014;and he got the idea that people would snap up Hawaiian pants. In the end, they got snapped up by us. We&#x2019;ve got a closet full of them, plus lots more at our self-storage in Pedroia. Later on came the tin futures. The tin futures looked good after some find in Bolivia, but then an earthquake buried everything, so here we were, back on the divorce beat.<br> <br>Our client was a sad-eyed little guy named Marvin Winkleman who owned a ticket agency downtown. Don&#x2019;t ask me what a ticket agency is. What&#x2019;s important is that he thought his wife was cheating, and coughed up the $500 retainer. Don&#x2019;t ask me about the cheating part, either. It&#x2019;s a human thing; we operate differently in my world. &#x201c;Just find out, one way or another,&#x201d; Winkleman said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to know.&#x201d;<br> <br>Later, driving away, Bernie said, &#x201c;Why do they always have to know? What&#x2019;s wrong with ignorance is bliss?&#x201d; I had no idea.<br> <br>We sat. Nothing happened. The dusty palm leaves hung motionless. Bernie got fidgety. He opened the glove box, checked behind the visor, patted his pockets. Poor Bernie. He never bought cigarettes anymore, was trying to quit. After a while he gave up, sat back, folded his arms. Bernie has nice strong arms. I kept my eyes on them. Time passed. Then I heard a faint metallic sound and looked out. The motel door opened and out came the blond woman, patting her hair. I glanced at Bernie. Hey! His eyes were closed. I barked, not a loud bark but the soft kind I swallow in my throat. Bernie&#x2019;s eyelids flew open. He put his hand on me, sat up straight, reached for the camera, and took her picture.<br> <br>The blond woman got in the convertible and checked herself in the mirror. Bernie took another picture. She put on lipstick, gave her mouth a nice stretch. I gave my mouth a nice stretch, too, for no reason. &#x201c;Looks pretty happy, doesn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d; Bernie said. She backed out of her space, drove out of the lot and down the street, away from us. Bernie took pictures of the motel, the blinking sign outside, the palm tree, and me. Then we went back to watching the motel room door. &#x201c;Maybe there&#x2019;s no one in there,&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;Like she just enjoys a solitary little nap out in the desert now and then, making this a wild goose chase.&#x201d;<br> <br>Wild goose chase? I&#x2019;d heard that one before, wanted to go on a wild goose chase very badly, but there were no geese in sight. Once&#x2014;was this back when the Hawaiian pants returns started coming in?&#x2014;I&#x2019;d heard Bernie say, &#x201c;Our goose is cooked.&#x201d; But no cooked goose ever appeared. Meanwhile, I was hungry. The smell of burgers on the grill, while not as strong as&#x2014;<br> <br>The motel door opened. A man stepped out, a tall man in a white shirt and dark pants, knotting his tie. &#x201c;Bingo,&#x201d; said Bernie, I&#x2019;m not sure why. I knew bingo&#x2014;a game they played at the Police Athletic League fund-raiser, an event I&#x2019;d been to only once and probably wouldn&#x2019;t be back to, what with how exciting it turned out to be, and that unfortunate incident with my tail and all those little plastic chips on the chief&#x2019;s card&#x2014;but was this a time for games? Bernie aimed the camera at the man, gazed into it, and said, &#x201c;Oh my God.&#x201d; He slowly lowered the camera.<br> <br>The man glanced around in a quick way that reminded me of lots of perps we&#x2019;d taken down and walked to the dark sedan at the other end of the motel parking lot.<br> <br>&#x201c;Recognize him, Chet?&#x201d; said Bernie in a low voice.<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t sure. Nothing wrong with my eyes&#x2014;although Bernie says I can&#x2019;t be trusted when it comes to color, so don&#x2019;t put any money on the convertible being red&#x2014;but they&#x2019;re really more of a backup to my nose and my ears, and the man was too far away for me to get a whiff, plus he wasn&#x2019;t saying anything. Still, he moved in a way that was kind of familiar, stiff and long-legged, like one of those birds that can&#x2019;t fly, their name escaping me at the moment. The man unlocked the sedan. &#x201c;Those software geeks,&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;I should have known from the flip-flops. It&#x2019;s Malcolm.&#x201d;<br> <br>Malcolm? This divorce case dude was someone we knew already? I checked those feet: long skinny feet with long skinny toes. I remembered the smell of those feet, somewhat like a big round piece of cheese Bernie had once left outside for a day or two. Yes, Malcolm for sure. I didn&#x2019;t like Malcolm, even though I like just about every human I&#x2019;ve ever met, even some of the perps and gangbangers. Malcolm didn&#x2019;t like me, either; he was one of those humans who got nervous around my kind.<br> <br>Malcolm climbed into his car and drove away. &#x201c;What the hell are we going to do?&#x201d; Bernie said. Huh? Weren&#x2019;t we going to do what we always did when a divorce case worked out like this, which was deliver the evidence, collect the final check, grab a bite somewhere? &#x201c;Specifically, what are we going to do about Leda?&#x201d;<br> <br>Leda? What did . . .? But then I began to see, sort of. Bernie was divorced himself. He has a kid, Charlie, who we only get to see some weekends and holidays. Charlie mainly lives in a big house in High Chaparral Estates, one of the nicest developments in the whole Valley, with Bernie&#x2019;s ex-wife, Leda, and her boyfriend. The boyfriend was Malcolm. What else do you need to know? Maybe just that Bernie misses Charlie a lot&#x2014;and so do I&#x2014;but he never misses Leda&#x2014;and neither do I. And then there&#x2019;s Suzie Sanchez, a reporter for the <i>Valley Tribune</i> and sort of Bernie&#x2019;s girlfriend. Suzie smells great&#x2014;kind of like soap and lemons&#x2014;and has a full box of treats in her car at all times. She&#x2019;s a gem.<br> <br>Bernie felt under the seat, found a mangled cigarette, lit up. He took a deep breath, blew out a big smoke cloud. I love the smell, would smoke if I could. His whole body relaxed; I could feel it. I could also feel him thinking, a nice feeling, like breezes brushing by. I waited, my own mind empty and peaceful.<br> <br>&#x201c;We could tell her,&#x201d; he said after a while. &#x201c;Or not tell her.&#x201d;<br> <br>He smoked some more.<br> <br>&#x201c;If we tell her, what happens? Something, for sure. If we don&#x2019;t tell her, maybe nothing happens. Nothing is often the best policy.&#x201d; Bernie&#x2019;s hand reached out in that absentminded way it does sometimes and gave me a pat. Bernie&#x2019;s a great patter, the very best. &#x201c;Still, it&#x2019;s a time bomb, ticking away. But do all time bombs go off?&#x201d; Bombs? Bombs were somehow in the picture? Wasn&#x2019;t this divorce work? I knew bombs, of course, could sniff them out, something I&#x2019;d learned in K-9 school. I&#x2019;d done pretty well in K-9 school, up until the very last day. The only thing left had been the leaping test. And leaping is just about my very best thing. Then came some confusion. Was a cat involved? And blood? I ended up flunking out, but that was how Bernie and I got together, so it worked out great. But forget all that. The point is I can smell bombs, and there was no bomb smell in the air outside the motel. Detective work could be confusing. You had to be patient. &#x201c;Got to be patient, big guy.&#x201d; Bernie said that a lot. It meant just sitting, not always so easy.<br> <br>Bernie took one last drag, then got out of the car and ground the butt into the dirt. He had a thing about forest fires, although there were no forests around out here in the desert, just this palm tree, a few shrubs, rocks, dirt. Bernie turned to me. &#x201c;Is ignorance bliss? Hits a little closer to home now, doesn&#x2019;t it, Chet?&#x201d;<br> <br>Didn&#x2019;t quite get that. Were we going home? Fine with me, but shouldn&#x2019;t we swing by the client first, pick up the check? Otherwise why bother with divorce work?<br> <br>Bernie got back in the car, started to turn the key, then went still. &#x201c;And what&#x2019;s best for Charlie?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>We left the desert, rode up and over the mountain pass where the air is always so fresh&#x2014;I had my head stuck way out&#x2014;and back into the Valley. The Valley is huge, goes on forever in all directions. The air got less fresh and started shimmering, the sky turning from blue to hazy orange. Bernie&#x2019;s hands tightened on the wheel. &#x201c;Imagine what this looked like when Kit Carson rode through,&#x201d; he said. Kit Carson comes up from time to time. I couldn&#x2019;t remember what he&#x2019;d done, but if it was bad we&#x2019;d bring him down eventually. Message to Kit Carson: an orange jumpsuit is in your future.<br> <br>The downtown towers appeared, just the tops of them, the rest lost in the haze. Soon we were down in the haze ourselves. We parked in front of one of the towers and went into a coffee shop on the ground floor. No one there except Marvin Winkleman, sitting at a front table and gazing into his coffee cup, head down. Hey! He was one of those comb-over dudes. Love comb-overs! Humans can be very entertaining, no offense.<br> <br>Winkleman looked up. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got news?&#x201d; Human sweat is a big subject, but for now, let&#x2019;s just say the nervous kind has a special tang that travels a long way, very easy to sniff out, and I was sniffing it out now.<br> <br>Bernie nodded and took a seat at the table. I sat on the floor beside him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good news or bad?&#x201d; said Winkleman.<br> <br>Bernie put the laptop on the table, turned it so Winkleman could see, and plugged in the camera. &#x201c;These are in sequence,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;time stamped at the bottom left.&#x201d;<br> <br>Winkleman looked at the pictures, his face gray in the laptop&#x2019;s light. His sad eyes got sadder. &#x201c;Who is he?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Bernie was silent for a moment. Then he said, &#x201c;Does it really matter?&#x201d;<br> <br>Winkleman thought. His thoughts weren&#x2019;t like soft breezes, were more like dark shadows that I didn&#x2019;t want near me. &#x201c;Guess not,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the point?&#x201d; He put his head in his hands. This happens sometimes, maybe like the human head can get to be too much to support.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um,&#x201d; said Bernie. When he feels uncomfortable he bites his lip; he was doing it now. &#x201c;Do, uh, you have any kids?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We were waiting for the right time.&#x201d; Or something like that: kind of hard to hear, with Winkleman&#x2019;s hands covering his face.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said Bernie. &#x201c;Then, uh . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Winkleman uncovered his face. A tear rolled out of one eye. Waterworks: I was always on the lookout for that. Human tears taste salty. I know from this one time Charlie cried after he fell off his bike, and I licked his face. I had no desire to lick Winkleman&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re telling me things could be worse?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe a clich�,&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;Not very helpful, in retrospect.&#x201d;<br> <br>Winkleman wiped away the tear. &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Crazy to take it out on the messenger.&#x201d; He opened his checkbook. &#x201c;How much do I owe you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bernie checked his watch. &#x201c;Today doesn&#x2019;t count as a full day.&#x201d; <i>Oh, Bernie.</i> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s call it eight hundred.&#x201d;<br> <br>Winkleman handed over the check. &#x201c;Got any kids yourself?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;One.&#x201d;<br> <br>Winkleman reached into his pocket, produced a big wad of tickets, gave Bernie two. &#x201c;Here,&#x201d; he said. New tears welled up in his eyes, trembled at the edge of the lower lids. &#x201c;Kids like the circus.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bernie rose. At that moment I noticed a little something on the floor. I couldn&#x2019;t think of the name of that little something for the longest time, not until after I&#x2019;d snapped it up and swallowed it down. Croissant: that was it. Not the sausage-and-egg kind, which I&#x2019;d had once behind a Dumpster at the North Valley Mall, but still: delish, and I&#x2019;d been hungry since the stakeout. Could have downed another croissant, in fact, and maybe even another after that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Chet? You coming?&#x201d;<br> <br>We headed for the door. Just as we went out, I glanced back and saw Winkleman standing by a trash receptacle. He took the gold ring off his finger and dropped it inside. Bernie had a gold ring that looked just the same. He kept it in a drawer in the office. I came very close to having a big thought, but it didn&#x2019;t quite come.<br> <br>The phone buzzed just as Bernie started up the car. Bernie had the phone rigged so the voice came through the speakers. &#x201c;Bernie? Amy here.&#x201d; I knew Amy. She was the vet. A nice woman, big and round, with soft hands, but I never liked going to the vet. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got the lab report on that lump.&#x201d; Bernie leaned forward.<br> <br>� 2010 SPENCER QUINN</p><h2>Brown Church: Five Centuries of Latina/o Social Justice, Theology, and Identity</h2><p><strong>Interest in and awareness of the demand for social justice as an outworking of the Christian faith is growing. But it is not new.</strong> For five hundred years, the Latina/o culture and identity has been shaped by its challenges to the religious, socio-economic, and political status quo, whether in its opposition to Spanish colonialism, Latin American dictatorships, US imperialism in Central America, the oppression of farmworkers, or the current exploitation of undocumented immigrants. Christianity has played a significant role in that movement at every stage. Robert Chao Romero, the son of a Mexican father and a Chinese immigrant mother, explores the history and theology of what he terms the "Brown Church." Romero considers how this movement has responded to these and other injustices throughout its history by appealing to the belief that God's vision for redemption includes not only heavenly promises but also the transformation of every aspect of our lives and the world. Walking through this history of activism and faith, readers will discover that Latina/o Christians have a heart after God's own.</p><p>Robert Chao Romero (PhD, University of California at Los Angeles; JD, University of California at Berkeley) is associate professor in the Departments of Chicana/o Studies and Asian American Studies at the University of California at Los Angeles. He is the author of the award-winning, <em>The Chinese in Mexico, 1882-1940</em>, <em>Jesus for Revolutionaries: An Introduction to Race, Social Justice, and Christianity</em>, and <em>Mixed Race Student Politics</em>.&#34;While it focuses on the Brown Church and presents a dramatic and engaging picture of Brown experience and theology, this book is about much more than the Brown Church. It is about church, gospel, truth, and justice. It is about me who is brown but also about you who are not. This is an important read for any who wish to be faithful Christians in today&#39;s context.&#34; (Justo L. Gonz�lez, historian and theologian)</p><h2>The Nonprofit Strategy Revolution: Real-Time Strategic Planning in a Rapid-Response World</h2><p><p><b>Turner Publishing proudly presents a fully-updated edition of <i>The Nonprofit Strategy Revolution</i> FINALIST, Ben Franklin Awards, Independent Book Publishers Association, Business Category</b></p><br><br><p>The world changes continuously and rapidly.

The book provides a thorough examination of the underlying reasons as well as the ways in which &#34;white people&#34; were created. It also explains how the creation of this distinction divided laborers and ultimately served the interests of the elite. The book goes on to examine how foundational law and policy in the U.S. were used to institutionalize the practice of &#34;white people&#34; holding positions of power. Finally, the book demonstrates how the social construction and legal enactment of &#34;white people&#34; has ultimately compromised the humanity of those so labeled. Jacqueline Battalora was born in Edinburg, Scotland and lived in Antwerp, Belgium for six years before her family relocated to Victoria, Texas. It was this experience of attending high school and middle school in Victoria that informed her understanding of race in America. While she is currently a lawyer and professor of sociology and criminal justice at Saint Xavier University, she is also a former Chicago Police officer. She holds a Ph.D. from Northwestern University and has been engaged in anti-racist training since the mid 1990s.

According to Visconte Simon Cocozza, Trainer and Examiner for the La F�d�ration Fran�aise d'Equitation (FFE), it all comes down to the horse&#x2019;s posture.</p> <p>The horse&#x2019;s ability to use the powerful mechanisms already built into his body relies not upon the strength we can see on the outside but the strength on the inside. This invisible and complex arrangement of internal &#x201c;core&#x201d; muscles control the horse&#x2019;s posture, suppleness, and agility. Their good condition is the key to the dance.</p> <p>Equine core muscles are very difficult to isolate with the traditional training techniques common to horse sports. However, by examining what we do with the human body when faced with a weak core, we can find new methods for conditioning these areas of the equine body. Cocozza has taken principles of the human practice of yoga and used them to develop novel ways of reaching deep within the horse&#x2019;s body and: </p><ul> <li>Gently &#x201c;unlock&#x201d; areas that may be a little &#x201c;rusty.&#x201d;</li> <li>Improve core fitness.</li> <li>And even relieve pain related to conditions such as kissing spine.</li> </ul> <p>In this highly illustrated book, he provides step-by-step instruction explaining easy mounted exercises that enhance the horse&#x2019;s posture, and boost his confidence in his body and movement, making him easier to ride, and ultimately, the dance partner you&#x2019;ve always imagined.</p></p><p>After growing up in Rome, Italy, <b>Simon Cocozza</b> was educated in England. The family passion for horses inspired him to study for the British Horse Society's BHSAI, followed by the Instructor training of the Advanced National Certificate in Equine Business Management at Warwickshire College of Equine Studies. This led to many years as a professional trainer contracted to some of England&#x2019;s large equestrian centers. After returning to mainland Europe, Cocozza studied with some wonderful mentors and became driven to overcome the limits set by the horse industry on horses, and to discover the unifying principles behind Greek, Roman, and the Renaissance school of equestrian art to find ways of helping each and every horse be as healthy, happy and useful as he can be. Cocozza became the first non-French national to obtain the Brevet Professionnel and become a Trainer and Examiner for the La F�d�ration Fran�aise d'Equitation (FFE). He now coaches biomechanically sound training techniques internationally. He's based in Normandy, France."I love this book! My Swedish Warmblood mare needs to build core strength. I found the exercises to not only work to do that, my mare actually enjoys them! They have improved her flexibility, and since she seems to find them relaxing, I think it has improve our bond as well. I highly recommend this book!" <b>Elite Equestrian</b><br><br>"Overall, I believe Cocozza sets up readers for success with their horses. I look forward to enacting the exercise plan with my horse and foresee a lot of arena dirt ground into the binding of my copy, as I&#x2019;ll need it with me for a reference while I ride." <b>Horse Nation</b><br><br>"If you want a full arsenal of flatwork exercises to help keep your horse strong and loose, check out <i>Core Conditioning for Horses</i>. I have ridden with a Charles de Kunffy protege for years, so this book piggybacked perfectly off of his concept of dressage as a way to &#x201c;gymnasticize&#x201d; the horse&#x2019;s body. The goal of flatwork should always be to make the horse stronger and more supple, and this book includes plenty of exercises (and pictures) to get you there. There are even suggestions for things to try for horses with kissing spines, for example. None of the work is particularly difficult to understand, so any semi-competent rider should be able to get something useful from it. Think of it as being kinda like yoga for horses." <b>the900dollarfacebookpony.com</b></p><h2>Coco Chanel: My First Coco Chanel (Volume 1) (Little People, BIG DREAMS, 1)</h2><p><b>This board book version of <i>Coco Chanel</i>&#x2014;the first title in the critically acclaimed Little People, BIG DREAMS series&#x2014;introduces the youngest dreamers to this international style icon.</b><br><br> Following the death of her mother, Coco spent her early life in an orphanage, where she was taught how to use a needle and thread.

His job, his marriage, even his children all feel disconnected and distant. Has he really accomplished nothing of consequence in his life? One Christmas Day, Travis plays a round of golf and finds himself for the first time in the zone-playing like a pro. In astonishingly short order, Travis is catapulted into the PGA Senior Open at Pebble Beach, where he advances to the final round. And while his wife, his children, and a live television audience watch, a miracle takes place that changes Travis and his family forever.<br></p><p>James Patterson has had more <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers than any other writer, ever, according to <i>Guinness World Records</i>.

He is the author of the Alex Cross novels<b>,</b> the most popular detective series of the past twenty-five years, including <i>Kiss the Girls </i>and <i>Along Came a Spider</i>. He writes full-time and lives in Florida with his family.<br>While it isn't quite the literary equivalent of a hole-in-one, this fast-moving golf fantasy about an amateur golfer who decides to try out for the PGA Senior Tour has enough sweetness and humor to overcome its obvious plot cliches. Middle-aged and happily married, Travis McKinley does the unthinkable: he misses Christmas dinner after getting caught up in a divinely inspired streak of great putting during an outing on the country club course in Winnetka, Ill. As Travis's obsession with his newfound talent takes over his life, his obstetrician wife, Sarah, expresses increasing dismay over his inability to grow up, a domestic crisis that reaches a boiling point when Travis loses his job and journeys to Tallahassee, Fla., to try to qualify for the Senior Tour. Competing against overwhelming odds, Travis earns a place on the tour, only to have his dream spoiled when he learns that Sarah intends to file for divorce. As he continues to compete against the likes of Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino, the victory that will fulfill Travis's dream and reunite him with his family is as improbable as it is inevitable. Plot issues aside, Patterson (whose newest thriller is Jack and Jill) and de Jonge succeed admirably in creating a winning character who is enough of a child to believe his dreams and is also mature enough to offer some gently humorous reflections on our national obsession with an engaging sport.

They believe that if they develop the right innovation, they will disrupt their markets forever and drive the kind of growth worthy of a magazine cover story. But as bestselling author Charlene Li explains, that&#x2019;s not how disruption works. Disruption doesn&#x2019;t create growth; instead, growth creates disruption.</b></p><p>Growth is always hard, and disruptive growth is exponentially harder. It requires companies to make tough decisions in the face of daunting uncertainties: Should we bet our company&#x2019;s future on next-generation customers or today&#x2019;s reliable ones? Should we abandon our current business model for an entirely new one? Making bold changes demands bold leadership and, often, massive cultural transformation.</p><p>Over the years, Li has seen some organizations beat the odds and succeed at becoming disruptive: Adobe, ING Bank, Nokia, Southern New Hampshire University, and T-Mobile, among them. Their stories make it clear that organizations don&#x2019;t have to be tech start-ups or have the latest innovations to transform. What they need to do is develop a disruptive mindset that permeates every aspect of the organization. Li lays out how to do so by focusing on three elements:</p> <ul> <li>a strategy designed to meet the needs of future customers;</li> <li>leadership that creates a movement to drive and sustain transformation; and</li> <li>a culture that thrives on disruptive change.</li> </ul> <p>Drawing on interviews with some of the most audacious people driving disruptive transformation today, Li will inspire leaders at all levels to answer the call to lead disruptive transformation in their organizations, communities, and society.</p></p><p><b>Charlene Li</b> is the founder and CEO of Altimeter Group and the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Open Leadership: How Social Technology Can Transform How You Lead</i>.

The book has three sections: The first briefly introduces the third wave theories that have recently expanded the frame of the topic; the second uses those theories to focus on specific aspects of student development; and the third brings it all together with a few chapters that look at the implications for practice.<br> <br>The first section includes a chapter that provides an overview of the evolution of student development theories as well as chapters describing the critical and poststructural theories most relevant to the next iteration of student development theory. These theories include critical race theory, queer theory, feminist theories, intersectionality, decolonizing/indigenous theories, and crip theories. These chapters also include a discussion of how each theory is relevant to the central questions of student development theory. <br><br>The second section provides critical interpretations of the primary constructs associated with student development theory. These constructs and their related ideas include resilience, dissonance, socially constructed identities, authenticity, agency, context, development (consistency/coherence/stability), and knowledge (sources of truth and belief systems). Each chapter begins with brief personal narratives on a particular construct; the chapter authors then re-envision the narrative&#x2019;s highlighted construct using one or more critical theories. <br><br>The third section will focus on implications for practice. Specifically, these chapters will consider possibilities for how student development constructs re-envisioned through critical perspectives can be utilized in practice.<br><br>The primary audience for the book is faculty members who teach in graduate programs in higher education and student affairs and their students. The book will also be useful to practitioners seeking guidance in working effectively with students across the convergence of multiple aspects of identity and development.</p><p>Elisa S. Abes is associate professor at Miami University (Ohio) in the student affairs in higher educaiton program in the Department of Educational Leadership.<br><br>Susan R.

Abes, Jones, Stewart, and chapter authors have transformed the theoretical foundation of student affairs into a more complex and liberatory understanding of student development, and for that I am eternally grateful.&#x201d;</p> (Jason C. Garvey, Associate Professor of Higher Education and Student Affairs Administration <i>University of Vermont</i>)<br><br><p> &#x201c;The field has been waiting for this book. It brings together in one place a host of the most thoughtful scholars working in, with, and through critical frameworks in student development theory. On their own, each chapter offers valuable insight; the volume as a whole takes the reader into the latest thinking using critical theory to understand and work with college students.&#x201d;</p> (Kristen A. Renn, Professor of Higher, Adult, &amp; Lifelong Education, and Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies for Student Success Research <i>Michigan State University</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;This book is exactly what we need to push our thinking about student development theory forward. As a field, we have been stymied for some time around SDT, and the authors of this book give permission for educators to pursue new and different questions and practices through critical and post-structural lenses. I am excited to use this text in my courses and have already been inspired by the authors&#x2019; ideas to create new assignments pushing students to better integrate critical praxis in their work as student affairs educators.&#x201d;</p> (Chris Linder, Assistant Professor, Higher Education <i>University of Utah</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;My read of <i>Rethinking College Student Development Theory Using Critical Frameworks</i> generated one thought: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about time!&#x201d; This must-read volume is a major contribution to the field of student affairs. The editors have assembled a book that not only unpacks and acknowledges the vast complexities that shape students&#x2019; college experiences, but also raises educators&#x2019; critical consciousness in translating theory to practice. This book should be required reading in graduate programs, especially within advanced student development theory courses.&#x201d;</p> (Lori Patton Davis, Professor of Higher Education and Student Affairs and Chair, Department of Educational Studies <i>The Ohio State University</i>)</p><h2>Leading the Lean Enterprise Transformation</h2><p><p>Updated with new information, illustrations, and leadership tools,<b> Leading the Lean Enterprise Transformation, Second Edition</b> describes how the metrics used by Toyota drive every line item in a financial statement in the right direction.

I&#x2019;ve heard it all. That they can haunt and govern you. That they can poison relationships and divide families. That in the end, only the truth will set you free. Maybe that&#x2019;s the case for some people and some secrets. But I truly believed I was the exception to such portents, and never once breathed the smallest mention of my nearly two-decade-long secret to anyone. Not to my closest friends in my most intoxicated moments or to my boyfriend, Peter, in our most intimate ones. My father knew nothing of it&#x2014;and I didn&#x2019;t even discuss it with my mother, the only person who was there when it all happened, almost as if we took an unspoken vow of silence, willing ourselves to let go, move on. I never forgot, not for a single day, yet I was also convinced that sometimes, the past really was the past.<br>I should have known better. I should have taken those words to heart&#x2014;the ones that started it all on that sweltering night so long ago: <i>You can run but you can&#x2019;t hide</i>.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>But those words, that night, my secret, are the farthest things from my mind as Peter and I stroll down Bleecker Street following a lingering dinner at Lupa, one of our favorite restaurants in the city. After several stops and starts, winter seems over for good, and the balmy spring night is made warmer by the bottle of Barolo Peter ordered. It&#x2019;s one of the many things I admire about him&#x2014;his fine taste coupled with his firm belief that life is too short for unexceptional wine. Unexceptional anything really. He is too kind and hardworking to be considered a snob, shunning his lazy trust fund acquaintances who accomplished &#x201c;nothing on their own,&#x201d; but he&#x2019;s certainly an elitist, having always traveled in prep school, power circles. I&#x2019;m not uncomfortable in that world&#x2014;but had always existed on the fringe of it before Peter brought me into his vortex of jet shares, yachts, and vacation homes in Nantucket and St. Bart&#x2019;s.<br>&#x201c;Ah! Finally. No slush on the sidewalks,&#x201d; I say, happy to be wearing heels and a light cardigan after months of unseemly rubber boots and puffy winter coats.<br>&#x201c;I know&nbsp;... <i>Quel soulagement,</i>&#x201d; Peter murmurs, draping his arm around me. He is possibly the only guy I know who can get away with musing in French without sounding insufferably pretentious, perhaps because he spent much of his childhood in Paris, the son of a French runway model and an American diplomat. Even after he moved to the States when he was twelve, he was allowed to speak only French at home, his accent as flawless as his manners.<br>I smile and bury my cheek against his broad shoulder as he plants a kiss on the top of my head and says, &#x201c;Where to now, Champ?&#x201d;<br>He coined the nickname after I beat him in a contentious game of Scrabble on our third date, then doubled down and did it again, gloating all the while. I laughed and made the fatal mistake of telling him &#x201c;Champ&#x201d; was the ironic name of my childhood dog, a blind chocolate Lab with a bad limp, thus sealing the term of endearment. &#x201c;Marian&#x201d; was quickly relegated to mixed company, throes of passion, and our rare arguments.<br>&#x201c;Dessert?&#x201d; I suggest, as we turn the corner. We contemplate Magnolia&#x2019;s cupcakes or Rocco&#x2019;s cannolis, but decide we are too full for either, and instead walk in comfortable silence, wandering by caf�s and bars and throngs of contented Villagers. Then, moved by the wine and the weather and a whiff of his spicy cologne, I find myself blurting out, &#x201c;How about marriage?&#x201d;<br>At thirty-six and after nearly two years of dating, I&#x2019;ve had the question on my mind, the subject one of speculation among my friends. But this night marks the first time I&#x2019;ve broached the topic with him directly, and I instantly regret my lapse of discipline and brace myself for an unsatisfying response. Sure enough, the mood of the night instantly shifts, and I feel his arm tense around me. I tell myself it isn&#x2019;t necessarily a bad sign; it could just be poor timing. It even occurs to me that he could already have the ring&#x2014;and that his reaction has more to do with my stealing his thunder.<br>&#x201c;Oh, forget it,&#x201d; I say with a high-pitched, forced laugh, which only makes things more awkward. It&#x2019;s like trying to retract an &#x201c;I love you&#x201d; or undo a one-night stand. Impossible.<br>&#x201c;Champ,&#x201d; he says, then pauses for a few beats. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re so good together.&#x201d;<br>The sentiment is sweet, even promising, but it&#x2019;s not even close to being an answer&#x2014;and I can&#x2019;t resist telling him as much. &#x201c;<i>Sooo</i> that means&nbsp;... what, exactly? Status quo forever? Let&#x2019;s hit City Hall tonight? Something in between?&#x201d; My tone is playful, and Peter seizes the opportunity to make light of things.<br>&#x201c;Maybe we should get those cupcakes after all,&#x201d; he says.<br>I don&#x2019;t smile, the vision of an emerald-cut diamond tucked into one of his Italian loafers beginning to fade.<br>&#x201c;Kidding,&#x201d; he says, pulling me tighter against him. &#x201c;Repeat the question?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Marriage. Us. What do you think?&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Does it ever even&nbsp;... cross your mind?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes. Of course it does...&#x201d;<br>I feel a &#x201c;but&#x201d; coming like you can feel rain on your face after a deafening clap of thunder. Sure enough, he finishes, &#x201c;But my divorce was just finalized.&#x201d; Another noncommittal nonanswer.<br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; I say, feeling defeated as he glances into a darkened storefront, seemingly enthralled by a display of letterpress stationery and Montblanc pens. I make a mental note to buy him one, having nearly exhausted gifts in the &#x201c;what to buy someone who has everything&#x201d; category, especially someone as meticulous as Peter. Cuff links, electronic gadgets, weekend stays at rustic New England B and Bs. Even a custom LEGO statue of a moose, the unofficial mascot of his beloved Dartmouth.<br>&#x201c;But your marriage has been over for a long time. You haven&#x2019;t lived with Robin in over <i>four</i> years,&#x201d; I say.<br>It is a point I make often, but never in this context, rather when we are out with other couples, on the off chance that someone sees me as the culprit&#x2014;the mistress who swooped in and stole someone else&#x2019;s husband. Unlike some of my friends who seem to specialize in married men, I have never entertained so much as a wink or a drink from a man with a ring on his left hand, just as I, in the dating years before Peter, had zero tolerance for shadiness, game playing, commitment phobias, or any other symptom of the Peter Pan syndrome, a seeming epidemic, at least in Manhattan. In part, it was about principle and self-respect. But it was also a matter of pragmatism, of thirty-something life engineering. I knew exactly what I wanted&#x2014;<i>who</i> I wanted&#x2014;and believed I could get there through sheer effort and determination just as I had doggedly pursued my entire career in television.<br>That road hadn&#x2019;t been easy, either. Right after I graduated from film school at NYU, I moved to L.A. and worked as a lowly production assistant on a short-lived Nickelodeon teen sitcom. After eighteen months of trying to get lunch orders straight in my head and not writing a single word for the show, I got a job as a staff writer on a medical drama series. It was a great gig, as I learned a lot, made amazing contacts, and worked my way up to story editor, but I had no life, and didn&#x2019;t really care for the show. So at some point, I took a gamble, left the safety of a hit show, and moved back to New York into a cozy garden apartment in Park Slope. To pay the bills, I sold a couple specs and did freelance assignments for existing shows. My favorite spot to write became a little family-owned bar named Aggie&#x2019;s where there was constant drama between the four brothers, much of it inspired by the women they married and their Irish-immigrant mother. I found myself ditching my other projects and sketching out their backstories, until suddenly <i>South Second Street</i> was born (I moved the bar from modern-day Brooklyn to Philly in the seventies). It wasn&#x2019;t high concept like everything in television seemed to be becoming, but I was old-school, and believed I could create a compelling world with my writing and characters&#x2014;rather than gimmicks. My agent believed in me, too, and after getting me in to pitch my pilot to all the major networks, a bidding war ensued. I took a deal with a little less money (but still enough for me to move to Manhattan) and more creative license. And voil�. My dream had come true. I was finally an executive producer. A showrunner.<br>Then, one intense year later, I met Peter. I knew his name long before I actually met him from the industry and snippets in <i>Variety</i>: Peter Standish, the esteemed television executive poached from another network, the would-be savior to turn around our overall struggling ratings and revamp our identity. As the new CEO, he was technically my boss, another one of my rules for whom not to date. However, the morning I ran into him at the Starbucks in our building lobby, I granted myself an exception, rationalizing that I wasn&#x2019;t one of his direct reports&#x2014;the director of programming buffered us in the chain of command. Besides, I already had a name. My series was considered a modest hit, a tough feat for a mid-season show, so nobody could accuse me of using him to get ahead or jump-start a stalling career.<br>Of course at that point, as I stood behind him in line, eavesdropping as he ordered a &#x201c;double tall cappuccino extra dry,&#x201d; the matter was completely theoretical. He wasn&#x2019;t wearing a ring (I noticed instantly), but he gave off an unavailable vibe as I tapped him on the shoulder, introduced myself, and issued a brisk, professional welcome. I knew how old ...</p><h2>The Tale of Two Bad Mice (Peter Rabbit)</h2><p>To celebrate Peter's birthday, Frederick Warne is publishing new editions of all 23 of Potter's original tales, which take the very first printings of Potter's works as their guide. The aim of these editions is to be as close as possible to Beatrix Potter's intentions while benefiting from modern printing and design techniques.<br><br> The colors and details of the watercolors in the volumes are reproduced more accurately than ever before, and it has now been possible to disguise damage that has affected the artwork over the years. Most notably, <i>The Tale of Peter Rabbit</i> restores six of Potter's original illustrations. Four were sacrificed in 1903 to make space for illustrated endpapers, and two have never been used before.Of course, Beatrix Potter created many memorable children's characters, including Benjamin Bunny, Tom Kitten, Jemima Puddle-duck and Jeremy Fisher. But whatever the tale, both children and adults alike can be delighted by the artistry in Potter's illustrations, while they also enjoy a very good read. Because they have always been completely true to a child's experience, Potter's 23 books continue to endure.</p><p>Then those mice set to work to do all the mischief they could-especially Tom Thumb! He took Jane&#39;s clothes out of the chest of drawers in her bedroom, and he threw them out of the top floor window. The classic tale of naughty Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca has delighted children for more than 85 years--as only a Beatrix Potter story can. Now, with all the original text in a fully illustrated Worthington Press edition, Tom Thumb springs to life again for a whole new generation of readers.Beatrix Potter loved the countryside and spent much of her childhood drawing and studying animals. The Tale of Peter Rabbit� published in 1902, was her first book, expanded from an illustrated letter she had sent to a young friend. Beatrix Potter went on to publish more than 20 tales and collections of rhymes.</p><h2>Close to Home</h2><p><b>Home<br><br></b>Along the shores of Oregon's wild Columbia River, the Victorian mansion where Sarah McAdams grew up is as foreboding as she remembers.

Citatie, a country in the south, has declared war on Feravel, and the soldiers are sure to succeed because they will be mounted on hundreds of dragons enslaved or bred for combat. Creel, an enterprising dressmaker and Feravel's resident expert on these winged beasts, begs the king to allow her to enlist the help of local dragons to try and stop the attack. She works with her friend Marta, a mute soldier named Tobin (Marta's fianc�), and Prince Luka (Creel's love interest)&#x2014;and several winged comrades&#x2014;to discover the true power behind Citatie's dragon force and to try to and save her homeland.

Creel and Marta are both headstrong and enterprising, and their escapades make for an engaging read.

In other words, they took a few...liberties. And to be honest, they were not always appreciated.<br><br>This is the story of five little lads before they became five really big Founding Fathers.<br></p><p>Lane Smith has written and illustrated some of the most popular children&#39;s books in recent history. His titles with Jon Scieszka have included the Caldecott Honor winner The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales, as well as the best sellers The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs; Math Curse; and Science Verse. Lane&#39;s other high profile titles include Hooray for Diffendoofer Day! by Dr. Seuss and his own classic The Happy Hocky Family books. He and book designer Molly Leach live in Washington, CT.<i>Starred Review.</i> Grade 2-5&#x2013;Describing each man in turn as either bold, noisy, honest, clever, or independent, and taking many liberties with the truth, Smith relates how the Founding Fathers of the title&#x2013;and Jefferson, too&#x2013;played a part in securing Americas freedom. Hancocks penchant for sprawling his name across the chalkboard as a child led to his boldly writing the biggest signature on the Declaration of Independence. Reveres loud voice selling underwear in his shop came in handy when he had to scream The Redcoats are coming! Washingtons honest admission to chopping down trees led to his serving as president in New York City where there were few forests. Well, you get the idea. The pen-and-ink cartoon illustrations, richly textured with various techniques, add to the fun. Page turns reveal droll surprises such as young bewigged George, axe in hand and already missing some teeth, surveying his felled orchard, or Franklins rejoinder when the townspeople express their vexation with his clever sayings. Early American typefaces, parchment grounds, and vestiges of 18th-century life, like chamber pots and hoop toys, evoke a sense of the time. A true-and-false section in the back separates fact from fiction. While children will love the off-the-wall humor, there is plenty for adult readers to enjoy, too&#x2013;the clever fly leaf, puns (...that bell-ringing took a toll on young Paul), and more. Exercise your freedom to scoop up this one.<i>&#x2013;Marianne Saccardi, formerly at Norwalk Community College, CT</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I. Packer) comes a warning about how the "father of lies" attempts to mislead us, packaging destructive ideas in the guise of spiritual truth. </strong></p><p>Not every lie sounds untrue. Some just sound <em>right</em>. And some are repeated so often that they virtually become "common knowledge." This is what makes lies about God so dangerous. So we have to ask, what might God's enemy want us to believe to lead us astray? And would we even see it happening?</p><p>Award-winning writer and pastor Jared C. Wilson brings us this compelling and enlightening exploration of the popular and oftentimes pleasing ways spiritual darkness masquerades as light. With sharp insight, warm humor, and a shepherd's heart, Jared Wilson examines eight lines popular with too many Christians--eight <em>lies</em> the enemy wants us to believe--and provides eight lines of counterattack to help us regain our footing. Wilson names the lies-- including "God Just Wants You to Be Happy," "You Only Live Once," and "Let Go and Let God,"--and then reveals why they appeal to us, shows how they harm us, and provides ways to counteract them. We can renounce Satan&#x2019;s counterfeit gospel, but first we must see it for what it is. Jared Wilson shows us how.</p></p><p><p>Jared C.

Now, some of these don&#x2019;t occur naturally&#x2014;the man-made synthetic compounds&#x2014;and we&#x2019;ll cover them too. However, many ingredients for our Stuff exist inside the earth or on its surface. They only need to be harvested or extracted... Only!</b> </p><p>Once we start examining them, we soon find that each key ingredient requires a lot of <i>other</i> ingredients just to get it out of the earth, processed, and ready for use. In the case of paper, for example, we don&#x2019;t just need trees. We need metals to make the chainsaws and logging machines; trucks, trains, and even ships to cart the logs to processing plants; and oil to run all those machines and the plants themselves. We need water (a lot of it) for making the paper pulp. We usually need a chemical like bleach (no!) or hydrogen peroxide (better) to get a desirably light shade of paper. All in all, making one ton of paper requires the use of 98 tons of various other resources.1 And believe me when I say that&#x2019;s a pretty simple example. That&#x2019;s why we have to look at the whole materials economy, and often a map of the world, to get a clear picture of the ingredients that go into any one product on store shelves these days. </p><p>There are lots of ways to think about the various resources that come from the earth. For simplicity&#x2019;s sake I&#x2019;ll use just three categories: trees, rocks, and water. </p><p> <b> <b>Trees</b> </b> </p><p>As I said in the introduction, having grown up in Seattle, a green city in an even greener state, I love trees. Half of the land area in Washington State is covered in forests,2 and I visited them every chance I had. Over the course of my childhood I watched in dismay as more and more forests gave way to roads and malls and houses. </p><p>As I grew older, I learned that there are more than sentimental reasons to worry about the fate of our trees. Trees create oxygen, which&#x2014;may I remind us&#x2014;we need to breathe. That alone would seem sufficient motivation for us to keep them intact. As the lungs of the planet, forests work around the clock to remove carbon dioxide from the air (a process called carbon sequestration) and give us oxygen in return. These days scientists concerned about climate change research all sorts of elaborate, expensive, man-made schemes to sequester carbon from the atmosphere in hopes of moderating climate change. Seems like a waste if you ask me. We already have a natural system that not only sequesters carbon but also provides the exact kind of air we need to breathe: our trees. And their services are free! It doesn&#x2019;t get much better than that. </p><p>And there&#x2019;s more&#x2014;forests provide other vital services. They collect and filter our fresh water, maintaining the planet&#x2019;s overall hydrologic cycle and moderating floods and droughts. They maintain soil health by keeping the nutrient-rich topsoil in place. What are we <i>thinking</i>, destroying these obvious allies? </p><p>To name just one more reason that it&#x2019;s a terrible idea to cut down forests: one-quarter of all our prescription drugs are derived from forests&#x2014;rainforests in particular.3 Curare, an anesthetic and muscle relaxant used in surgery4; ipecac, for treating dysentery5; and quinine, for malaria6 are just a few examples. Not long ago, western chemists were turned on to a plant native to the tropical forests of Madagascar, the rosy periwinkle, after learning that the island&#x2019;s healers used it to treat diabetes. It turns out the pink-flowering plant has anticancer properties, and is now used to make the medicines vincristine and vinblastine. The former is used to treat Hodgkin&#x2019;s disease, and the latter has proven to be a total wonder drug for those suffering from childhood leukemia, who now have a 95 percent chance of survival, up from their previous slim 10 percent chance before the plant was discovered.7 </p><p>(Unfortunately, even though sales of the two drugs are in the hundreds of millions of dollars per year, almost none of this money winds up in the hands of the people in Madagascar, which is one of the poorest countries in the world.8 This will be a recurring theme.) </p><p>It&#x2019;s nuts to be wiping out forests anywhere on the globe, but it&#x2019;s especially crazy to be clearing the tropical rainforests because they contain such richness of biodiversity. Generally, the closer forests are to the equator, the greater the diversity of trees and other species they contain. A twenty-five-acre plot of rainforest in Borneo, for instance, can contain more than seven hundred species of trees, which is equal to the total number of tree species in all of North America.9 </p><p>And the plants and other life we&#x2019;ve discovered so far are just the beginning; most scientists estimate that only 1 percent of the species that exist in the rainforest (and only there) have been identified and examined for their beneficial properties.10 </p><p>If the loss wasn&#x2019;t so tragic, it would be ironic that these invaluable repositories of not-yet-discovered useful chemicals are being cleared in the name of &#x201c;progress&#x201d; and &#x201c;development.&#x201d; It seems to me a far wiser development strategy would be protecting these forests that will potentially heal our ills (as well as provide the air we breathe, clean our waters, and moderate our climate). </p><p>When I was kid savoring my time camping out in the forest, I hadn&#x2019;t ever heard of carbon sequestration, hydrologic cycles, or plant-derived pharmaceuticals. Instead, one big reason I loved forests was the many animals that lived in them. Forests provide homes for about two-thirds of the species on earth11&#x2014;from koala bears, monkeys, and leopards to butterflies, lizards, parrots, you name it. Cutting down these homes, especially in areas of rich biodiversity like tropical rainforests, leads to the extinction of as many as one hundred species a day.12 One hundred species per day? For some perspective, think of all the dogs you&#x2019;ve ever seen; worldwide, they make up fewer than ten species (genus <i>Canis</i>).13 And there&#x2019;s only <i>one</i> species of human! Losing one hundred species a day is a big deal. Those species could contain miracle medicines or could play some vital irreplaceable role in the food chain. Wiping them out is like throwing out our lottery ticket before we have even checked if we had the winning number. </p><p>Imagine for a minute that some other species (maybe <i>Periplaneta fuliginosa,</i> aka the smokybrown cockroach) had control over the planet and was eradicating one hundred species per day to satisfy their appetites. What would we say about them? We might think their actions were a little unfair. What would we <i>do</i> about them? Lead an insurrection? Of course, we might not have a chance&#x2014;from one day to the next we could just be extinguished, along with ninety-nine other lesser species. </p><p>And trees don&#x2019;t just house wildlife&#x2014;around the world about 300 million <i>people</i> live in forests, while about 60 million indigenous people are almost wholly dependent on them.14 Forests are the main source of life for more than a billion people living in extreme poverty.15 Forests provide the &#x201c;four F&#x2019;s&#x201d; essential for survival: food, fodder, fiber, and fuel. From healthy forests, indigenous, tribal, or other forest-dwelling communities gather or hunt for food, feed livestock, obtain materials to build homes, and collect firewood for cooking and heat. </p><p>As I was growing up in Seattle, my primary relationship with forests was based on a fifth F: fun. I relied on the forests for hiking, camping, birding, and cross-country skiing, not for building materials. If I needed a snack, I&#x2019;d head for the fridge, not the forest. Even after studying the issue, my understanding of the connection between forests and immediate survival was academic, not experiential. It wasn&#x2019;t until I went overseas that I realized how directly forests sustain life in other countries. </p><p>While traveling in the once lush Haitian countryside, I met families who had lost their homes after forests were cleared. After the destruction of the roots that held the soil in place and moderated water flows following a heavy rain, mudslides took the homes of those families. No forests, no flood control. In India, I saw women walking miles a day to collect branches to feed cows, patch roofs, or cook rice. No forests, no fodder, fiber, or fuel. Forests are essential to life. The values of all these kinds of services dwarf the price of timber from a felled forest. </p><p>In fact, economists are working to calculate the monetary benefits that forests produce. In October 2008, the European Union undertook a study to put a dollar value on the forest services that we&#x2019;re losing through deforestation each year. This study, published in <i>The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversit</i>y report, warns that the cost to the global economy from the loss of forests is far greater than the economic losses incurred up to that point in the banking crisis that garnered so much media attention and government action that year. Further, the report points out, the losses from deforestation aren&#x2019;t a one-time fiasco, but continuous, year after year.16 By evaluating the many services that forests perform and figuring out how much it would cost for humans to adapt to their losses and provide these services themselves, the study calculated the cost of forest loss at between $2 trillion and $5 trillion, or about 7 percent of global GDP <i>each year.</i>17 Now, if that doesn&#x2019;t merit a bailout on both economic and environmental grounds, I am not sure what does. </p><p>Despite the implications, even though they provide frames for our houses and our lifesaving medicines, even though they filter our water and create ...</p></p><h2>Supporting Behavior for School Success: A Step-by-Step Guide to Key Strategies</h2><p>Designed for busy teachers and other school-based professionals, this book presents step-by-step guidelines for implementing seven highly effective strategies to improve classroom management and instructional delivery.

Trauma leaves an imprint on the body, and if clinicians don't know how to stay embodied in the midst of these powerful relational moments, they risk shutting down with their clients or becoming overwhelmed by the process. If the body is not integrated into EMDR therapy, full and effective trauma treatment is unlikely.</p><p>This book offers an integrative model of treatment that teaches therapists how to increase the client's capacity to sense and feel the body, helps the client work through traumatic memories in a safe and regulated manner, and facilitates lasting integration.</p><p>Part I (foundational concepts) offers a broad discussion of theory and science related to trauma treatment. Readers will be introduced to essential components of EMDR therapy and somatic psychology. The discussion then deepens into the science of embodiment through the lens of research on emotion, memory, attachment, interpersonal neurobiology, and the impact of trauma on overall health. This part of the book emphasizes the principles of successful trauma treatment as phase-oriented, mindfulness-based, noninterpretive, experiential, relational, regulation focused, and resilience-informed.</p><p>Part II (interventions) presents advanced scripted protocols that can be integrated into the eight phases of EMDR therapy. These interventions provide support for therapists and clients who want to build somatic awareness through experiential explorations that incorporate mindfulness of sensations, movement impulses, breath, and boundaries.</p><p>Other topics discussed include a focus on complex PTSD and attachment trauma, which addresses topics such as working with preverbal memories, identifying ego states, and regulating dissociation; chronic pain or illness; and culturally-based traumatic events.

Both the boy and the sculpture seem to be out of place . . . and then, on the same night, they disappear! Calder's friends Petra and Tommy must fly out to help his father find him. But this mystery has more twists and turns than a Calder mobile . . . with more at stake than first meets the eye.</p><p>Blue Balliett is the author of several bestselling, acclaimed mystery novels, including Chasing Vermeer (a Book Sense Book of the Year and an Edgar Award winner), The Wright 3, The Calder Game, and The Danger Box.

He entered Brigham Young University as an engineering major, but soon realized this was not the right choice for him. Having decided to take time off from college, he headed to Taiwan where he stumbled into a job illustrating English textbooks, which he enjoyed. There, a friend introduced him to an illustration student, also from Brigham Young University. This introduction inspired Brett to eventually switch majors. After spending a year in Taiwan, he went back to BYU and transferred to the illustration department. In 1993 he received a fine arts degree in illustration.<br><br>Grade 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;Those precocious art sleuths Calder, Petra, and Tommy are back, and this mystery is every bit as intricate, engaging, and delightful as <i>Chasing Vermeer</i> (2004) and <i>The Wright 3</i> (2006, both Scholastic). The three seventh graders go with their class to an exhibit of Alexander Calder's mobiles at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. Soon after, Calder and his father travel to a remote village in England that has an anonymously donated Calder sculpture, the <i>Minotaur</i>, and a maze at Blenheim Park. Both the boy and the sculpture disappear on the same night. Balliett's love of words and her ability to tuck hidden, subtle clues into her story are evident throughout. Petra and Tommy fly to England to help Calder's dad and the police find their friend. The kids see mobiles everywhere: in the leaves, flying crows, paper trash. Indeed, the whole story is structured as a mobile, with plot and characters twisting and turning, moving and dancing around each other. The young sleuths are able to take what seems to be chance and coincidence and apply their own conclusions to the puzzle wrapped inside this mystery. Balliett's wonderful writing is full of foreshadowing, literary allusions, wordplay, and figurative language. Calder's signature yellow pentominoes play an important role, and the kids create a new code. Helquist's detailed illustrations enhance this multilayered story. Fans of the author's previous novels are in for a treat in this latest adventure.&#x2014;<i>Connie Tyrrell Burns, Mahoney Middle School, South Portland, ME</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Visit Christine at http://www.christinerimmer.com.<br><br>Chris heard a loud thump. The furnace had turned on: soon warmth would begin to flow through the rickety little house. She wrinkled her nose, then remembered that heaters always smelled of burning dust and soot the first day they operated. She returned her fingers to the laptop keys, and her concentration to the last chapter of her story about a twelve-year-old boy named Jake. After seven rewrites, Jake was finally about to enjoy some resolution to the previous 122 pages of pubescent tribulation he'd suffered in his first year of junior high school.<br><br>This was her fourth attempt at a young adult novel, and Chris knew she was getting closer. Of earlier attempts editors had used such words as <em>brisk, lively, smooth.</em> Also words such as <em>awkward, unresolved, clumsy in places.</em><br><br>She stopped typing and wrinkled her nose again. Should it smell <em>that</em> bad? She had asked the landlord if the furnace should be serviced or cleaned before she set the thermostat, but he'd assured her it was fine. Of course, he said everything was fine, and this old rat-trap was anything but. To be fair, she had never actually seen a rat, but she <em>had</em> swept up plenty of suspicious little pebbles, which she assumed were mouse turds. The traps she set, however, remained&#x2014;thank you, God&#x2014;abandoned.<br><br>She and the children had made do with oven heat until now, waiting as long as possible before turning on central heat. Utility bills were hard on a Christmas budget, and, when you got right down to it, hers was hardly a budget. But the temperature might drop to freezing tonight, and sleeping bags alone wouldn't keep the kids warm.<br><br>She looked at the kitchen clock. Nearly midnight. Her eyes were scratchy, but tonight she was determined to finish the last chapter. To be published...finally? Much of this great push, she had to admit, was for Jake himself, a great kid who deserved a resolution that was not awkward or clumsy in places. As did she.<br><br>As for publishing, the responses she collected had been consistently more encouraging, asking her to send future work. "Write what you know," a writing instructor had advised. Chris certainly knew what it was like to be twelve, to be struggling for self-reliance while simultaneously fighting feelings of incompetence. She knew this dilemma even better at twenty-seven.<br><br>The shrill siren of the smoke detector interrupted her musings. The sound wrapped strangling fingers around her heart and squeezed. Stunned, she looked up from the gridlock of library books, photocopied magazine articles and her laptop on the kitchen table. Through the kitchen door, her wide eyes quickly scanned the little living room with its two beanbag chairs, old television, clutter of secondhand toys and card table littered with the remnants of the macaroni-and-cheese dinner she had given the kids hours earlier.<br><br>And there, from the floor vents in the living room, poured smoke.<br><br>She bolted from the chair, fairly leaped to turn off the thermostat and raced into her kids' room. She grabbed one in each arm&#x2014;five-year-old Carrie and three-year-old Kyle.<br><br>"There's a fire in the house," she said, hustling them through the thick smoke and toward the door. "We have to get outside, quick." As she rushed past the smoking vents, she prayed the situation wasn't as grim as it looked. Maybe it was only dirt? Soot? Dead bugs? But she didn't pause in her flight out the front door.<br><br>Only when they were safely outside did she stop to take stock of her predicament. The neighborhood was dark. Even in broad daylight it left something to be desired; at night it seemed almost threatening. There was not so much as a yard light shining. Her seven-year-old Honda sat on the street, and she opened the car door, nearly threw the kids inside and reached into the back seat for a blanket. "Wrap up in this, Carrie. Wrap Kyle up, too. Come on, that's a girl. I have to get someone to call the fire department. Don't get out of the car. Don't. Do you hear?"<br><br>Kyle started to whimper, rubbing his eyes. Carrie pulled the blanket around her little brother and nodded to her mother. Then she began to comfort Kyle with little crooning, motherly sounds of "'s'okay...'s'okay...."<br><br>Chris slammed the car door shut and ran to the house next door. Like her own house, it was small, ramshackle and in need of a paint job. She rang the bell and pounded on the front door. After a minute or two she gave up, ran to the house across the street and began ringing and pounding and yelling. She was panicked. How long do you wait for someone to get up? She jumped from one foot to the other, cursing her decision to cancel her cell phone because it cost too much money. No light came on at this house, either. "Come on, c'mon! Anybody home?" The porch light across the street went on, where she had begun. "Damn," she muttered, turning away from the door to run. The porch light behind her came on. "Jeez," she hissed, doubling back.<br><br>A sleepy, unshaven and angry-looking man opened the door. He was holding his robe closed over boxer shorts. That was when Chris remembered she was wearing only an extralarge T-shirt, moccasins and her undies. Purple silk undies, to be precise. That was it.<br><br>"Call the fire department," she begged her unsavory-looking neighbor. "The furnace is on fire. My kids are in my car. Hurry. Hurry!"<br><br>She turned and ran back to her car. She opened the door. "Are you okay?" They looked like two little birds peeking out from under the blanket.<br><br>"Mommy, what about Cheeks?" Carrie asked.<br><br>"Cheeks is in the backyard, sweetie. He's okay." She lifted her head to listen. "He's barking. Hear him?"<br><br>Carrie nodded, and her yellow curls bounced. "Can Cheeks come in the car with us?"<br><br>"I'll get him in a minute. You stay right here. Promise?" Again Carrie nodded. "I'll be right back. The fire truck is on its way. Pretty soon you'll hear the siren."<br><br>"Will our house burn down?"<br><br>"Burn down?" Kyle echoed.<br><br>"It'll be okay. Stay here now. I'll be right back."<br><br>Chris knew it was stupid to go back into a burning building; people died that way. But under these circumstances, she rationalized, it wasn't entirely stupid. First of all, she had seen only smoke, no other evidence of a bona fide fire. Second, the house was so tiny that the kitchen table, where her laptop and all her research lay, couldn't be more than ten steps inside the front door, which she intended to leave open in the event she had to make a fast getaway. Third, she wasn't going inside unless it looked relatively safe.<br><br>She heard the distant trill of the siren. The station was only about a mile away. She would be quick. And the smoke was not terrible, not blinding or choking. She had a plan.<br><br>She filled her lungs with clean air and bolted toward the kitchen. Even if the whole house burned to a cinder, the refrigerator would remain intact, like the bathtub in a tornado, right? Since she couldn't possibly gather up all her materials and her laptop and get them out of the house in one trip, she opened the refrigerator door and started heaving papers into it. It wasn't even supposed to be a long book. How had she ended up with so much stuff? And the books&#x2014;the sourcebooks and expensive reference volumes&#x2014;went in next. One marked Sacramento Public Library landed in the butter dish, but she didn't have time for neatness. She yanked out a half gallon of two-percent milk to make room for a pile of photocopied pages&#x2014;the sirens were getting closer&#x2014;and replaced a jug of apple juice with the large, old dictionary she had gotten at a garage sale. The sirens seemed to be winding down.<br><br>Suddenly Chris started feeling woozy. The laptop, she thought dimly. Could she carry it out? But things started to blur. She looked toward the vents. That sucker, she thought remotely, was really smokin'....<br><br>The first fire engine stopped behind an old green Honda, and the men sprang off. The truck with ladders and hydraulics was right behind. As his men pulled a hose to a hydrant, Captain Mike Cavanaugh glanced at the burning house and approached the man in boxer shorts and a ratty bathrobe who stood on the curb. The furnace, he'd been told. He saw heat waves come off the roof. A furnace fire could have started in the basement, but in these old houses without fire-stops there could be an attic fire already. The ladder company would go up. Over his shoulder he called, "Take the peanut line in to fog it, and we'll open up the top." Then he turned to the bathrobed man. "Anyone in the house?"<br><br>"It ain't my house. Some woman's house. She's only lived there a couple of months. Them's her kids, there."<br><br>"Did you call it in?"<br><br>"Yeah, she was pounding on my door, said her furnace was on fire and her kids was in the car."<br><br>Mike felt someone tugging on his coat, and looked down. The face that stared up at him jarred him, almost cut through him. A little blond girl with the face of an angel, a face something inside him seemed to remember. She wore pajamas with feet, and beside her was a similarly attired little boy, one hand dragging a blanket and one hand holding on to his sister's pajamas.<br><br>"Our mother's in the house," she said. "She told us to stay in the car."<br><br>"Then you'd better get back in the car," he said. "I'll get your mother." He spoke gently, but he broke into a run, pulling at the mouthpiece of his air pack so he could cover his face. "There's a woman in there," he informed a firefighter nearby. "Number 56 will initiate rescue. Take over incident command." The man, Jim Eble, turned to pass the word.<br><br>"Women," Mike muttered. Women invariably thought there was something worth saving in a fire. Usually a purse or some jewelry, but sometimes they were goofy enough to go back after a pair of shoes, or a robe.<br><br>Even these thoughts left him totally unprepared for what he found just steps inside the front door: a small woman, her thick, wavy hair in a fat ponytail, wearing only slippers, an oversize T-shirt and purple&#x2014;yes, purple&#x2014;silk underwear. He knew about the underwear because she was actually bending over, digging in the refrigerator, in a house cloudy with smoke.<br><br>He tapped her on the shoulder. "What are you, hungry?" Through his mask it came out something like "Bflust uurrr doooo, flungee?"<br><br>When she turned toward him he instantly recognized the ashen pallor and the glassy eyes. She coughed, her knees buckled, and he put his hands on her waist. She folded over his shoulder like a duffel bag. He supposed she might toss her cookies down his back; it wouldn't be the first time.<br><br>He pointed that purple silk rump toward the front door. It was right beside his ear, creating an indelible impression even in the midst of chaos.<br><br>Once he got her outside, he put her down by the rear of the engine and pulled down his mask. "Anyone else in the house?" he barked.<br><br>"Cheeks...is in.. " she wheezed and choked "...the backyard."<br><br>"Cheeks?" he asked.<br><br>"Dog...wirehaired terrier," she managed. She gagged and fell against Jim, who held her shoulders and backed her up to the tailboard of the engine so she could sit down.<br><br>"I'll get the dog," Mike said to his friend. "Furnace is in the basement. We'll have to go down. Right smack in the middle of the house. That's not a new roof." He headed toward the backyard.<br><br>"Here," said Jim, pushing a mask toward Chris. "You'll feel a little better after some oxygen."<br><br>Chris decided this fireman was much gentler than the one who'd deposited her on the sidewalk. But his voice seemed to become smaller and more distant as her head whirled and her stomach flipped. She abruptly leaned away from him and lost her dinner and several cups of coffee in the street. Bracing a hand on the tailboard, she heaved and shuddered. The man handed her a bunch of gauze four-by-fours to wipe her mouth. "Sometimes you feel a lot better after that." He touched her back. "It'll be okay now. Take it easy."<br><br>Chris, mortified, accepted the wipes and mopped her nose and mouth, meanwhile dying of all kinds of embarrassment. A large green trash bag miraculously appeared and covered the mess. All of this, she assumed, must be standard business at a fire.<br><br>"Is our mother sick?" Carrie asked in a small voice.<br><br>"Mama?" came Kyle's echo.<br><br>The fireman hunkered down and smiled into their little faces. "Naw, not really. She smelled too much smoke, and it made her sick to her stomach. She feels better now. Dontcha, Mom?"<br><br>She straightened up, eyes closed, and nodded. She couldn't speak yet, but she felt her pea-green face turning red. The irony was not lost on her that her house was burning down, and all she felt was shame because she was wearing practically nothing and had thrown up in the street.<br><br>"Our mother is going to be upset if her book burns up," Carrie told the fireman.<br><br>"Well, now, we can always get another book, can't we? But it sure would be hard to find another mommy as special as this one. That's why we <em>never</em> go back into a house where there's a fire."<br><br>"Our mother is <em>typing</em> her book, and it takes a very long time and is very hard to do," Carrie informed him rather indignantly.<br><br>As the fireman glanced at Chris, she stretched her T-shirt down over her thighs. She was recovering now. "Never mind that, Carrie. The fireman is right&#x2014;I should not have gone back into the house. It was very dangerous and very stupid." She looked up at the fireman. "I don't suppose you have a drink of water?"<br><br>"Well," he said, standing and looking around, "water is pretty hard to come by."<br><br>She noticed three different hoses reaching across the lawn toward her smoking house and shook her head.<br><br>"I'll ask a neighbor," he said, moving away.<br><br>A minute or two later he returned with a paper cup. After she had taken a few swallows she noticed that he was holding a blanket toward her. "Thanks," she said, trading the water for the cover. "If I'd known you were coming, I would have dressed."<br><br>"No problem," he said. "Besides, you don't have to be embarrassed by those legs," he added as he turned away. The blanket, thankfully, reached her ankles.<br><br>"Whoa!" came a baritone shout, followed by a crashing sound.<br><br>Part of the roof where men had been poking opened up, and flames leaped out. Two firefighters came shooting out the front door of the house, then two others dragged a larger hose in. They were everywhere&#x2014;inside, outside, on the roof.<br><br>It was amazing, Chris thought. Just a few minutes ago she'd only seen a little smoke. Now there was a great deal more than smoke; redorange flames were eating up the little house.<br><br>Out of the darkness the tall fireman who had saved her life approached them with a silver ball of fur that went <em>grrrr</em> in his arms. He handed Cheeks to Chris. Cheeks, very particular about who carried him around, snarled and yapped in transit. He was cranky.<br><br></p><h2>Student Workbook for Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology and Anatomy</h2><p><p>Corresponding to the chapters in <i>Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, </i>5th Edition, this unique workbook gives you an extensive background in oral biology and the formation and study of dental structures.

She is also the author of the original <i>Tartine</i> cookbook, a James Beard Best Pastry Chef Award repeat nominee and winner, and the founder of the Conductive Education Center of San Francisco.<b>WHY THIS BOOK NOW</b><br><br> I remember once hearing that cookbooks are the novels of choice for working parents. That they are bedside reading, blueprints for a fantasy time when afternoons would be free enough to bake a cake or when flavor could be considered an equal to convenience in the morning.&nbsp;<br><br>Before becoming a parent and business owner, I found this utterly depressing. Of course, I understood indulging in a cookbook&#x2019;s pleasurable writing, but to only read and not cook from a cookbook? One caf�, two restaurants, and one nine-year-old daughter later, and I understand that limitations on time can reduce the family meal to a slapdash event on most days. I know that it&#x2019;s often easy to forget to pause to really taste the food, and this is despite the fact that I know how to cook well.&nbsp;<br><br> You see, there&#x2019;s no way around it: cooking is work. Work in that it requires forethought, a modicum of skill, and time. Work in that you must use your hands, stand on your feet, wash the dishes. (And, full disclosure: for my husband, Chad, and me, cooking <i>is </i>work. It is how we earn our living.) Your simple hope is that while sitting around the table to share the fruits of your labors, the effort fades to memory. Or better yet, the effort becomes part of a meal&#x2019;s pleasure, and that the experience of transforming ingredients into a sum greater than their parts connects you to the food in a far more profound way than any recipe lets on. That is the ideal, and to fess up to my own biases, I believe wholeheartedly that it&#x2019;s attainable.<br><br><b><br>QUICK VEGETABLE PICKLES</b><br><br>Makes 2 cups/280g<br> This versatile pickle&#x2014;our original recipe developed for the bakery&#x2014;is served alongside our hot-pressed sandwiches. Because the simmered pickling liquid is poured over the vegetables and left to sit off the heat, the pickles remain pleasantly crisp. Just as a cornichon cuts through a rich p�t�, these pickles brighten any meat or roast, from cured meats to chicken, pork, and beef. I like to slice the pickles paper-thin and add them to sandwiches, or finely chop and fold them into a slaw. The recipe itself is malleable, too. If you&#x2019;re after a sweeter, bread-and-butter&#x2013;style pickle, add 2 tsp of sugar. Vary the spices, as well as the vegetables, to your liking. I favor fermenting, but a quick pickle is good when you need a sandwich or picnic pickup.&nbsp;<br><br>1 cup/240ml white wine vinegar or champagne vinegar&nbsp;<br> 1 cup/240ml water<br> 2 cloves garlic, crushed<br> 1/4 tsp black peppercorns<br> 6 allspice berries (optional)<br> 6 whole cloves (optional)<br> 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes<br> 1 bay leaf<br> Pinch of granulated sugar<br> 1 tsp sea salt<br> 2 cups/280g sliced vegetables (such as small, hot peppers of any kind, bell peppers, red or yellow onion, cauliflower, small carrots, radishes, Persian cucumbers, or any combination of these vegetables)<br><br>Combine the white wine vinegar or champagne vinegar, water, garlic, peppercorns, allspice berries, whole cloves, red pepper flakes, bay leaf, sugar, and salt in a small saucepot and bring to a boil.

Goodnight Martians taking over the moon.</i></p><p>It's bedtime in the cold gray tomb with a black lagoon, and two slimy claws, and a couple of jaws, and a skull and a shoe and a pot full of goo. But as a little werewolf settles down, in comes the Goon determined at all costs to run amok and not let any monster have his rest.</p><p>A beloved classic gets a kind-hearted send up in this utterly monsterized parody; energetic art and a hilarious text will have kids begging to read this again and again.<br><br></p></p><p>Michael Rex has written and illustrated over 40 books for children, including the gruesomely hysterical, #1<i> New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Goodnight Goon</i>. His popular sword-swinging Fangbone! Graphic novels have been turned into an animated show that runs on Disney XD in the U.S., and many other markets worldwide. He visits schools across the country and internationally to share his books with students of all ages, and he has a master&#x2019;s degree in Arts Education. His work covers a wide range of styles, from the simple, goofy rhymes of <i>Truck Duck</i>, to the heavily illustrated, yuck-filled <i>Icky Ricky</i> chapter books. He lives in New Jersey with his wife, two boys, and a dog named Roxy.Grade 1&#x2013;3&#x2014;Imitation can indeed be sincere flattery, as Rex proves in his slightly eerie reworking of Margaret Wise Brown and Clement Hurd's classic bedtime tale. The young bunny has been replaced by a little monster, but he still wears striped pajamas as he lies in his bed and says good night to his surroundings. "In the cold gray tomb/There was a gravestone/And a black lagoon/And a picture of&#x2014;Martians taking over the moon." The parody is clever, matching original verse with rhymes that seem unforced and appropriate for the new setting: "Goodnight skull/And goodnight shoe/Goodnight creature/Goodnight goo/And goodnight to the old werewolf hollering 'Boo.'" Rex's color drawings create a monster child's bedroom filled with the same late-evening light of Hurd's illustrations. The book ends on the same peaceful note as the original. A clever offering just right for graduates of bedtimes with <i>Goodnight Moon</i>.&#x2014;<i>Kathleen Whalin, York Public Library, ME</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Davis wrote most of this book while staying at Beauvoir along the Mississippi Gulf Coast near Biloxi, Mississippi.</b> The book is much less a Davis memoir than an articulation of the secession argument. In Davis' earlier work, The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, he had written what is probably the most thorough exegesis of the compact theory of the United States Constitution in existence, devoting the first fifteen chapters of the book to that topic. Fearful that his readers might not understand, or might forget, he repeated the explanation every second or third chapter after that. Still concerned that people might not understand the compact theory of the Constitution, he wrote A Short History of the Confederate States of America shortly before his death. Jefferson Finis Davis (1808 &#x2013; 1889) was an American politician who served as the President of the Confederate States from 1861 to 1865. He was a member of the Democratic Party who represented Mississippi in the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives prior to becoming president of the Confederacy. He was the 23rd United States Secretary of War, serving under U.S. President Franklin Pierce from 1853 to 1857.</p><p>Jefferson Davis (1808-1889) was the president of the Confederacy during the American Civil War, served in the House of Representatives and the Senate, and was secretary of war under Franklin Pierce. <br>William J.

Art, the charismatic leader of the group and creator of the pact, insists that the agreement must remain unshakable and enduring. But this year, he never shows up.<br><br>A visit to his house increases the friends' worry; Art is farming marijuana. In Southern Italy doing that kind of thing can be very dangerous. They can't go to the Carabinieri so must make enquiries of their own. This is how they come across the rumours about Art; bizarre and unbelievable rumours that he miraculously cured the local mafia boss's daughter of terminal leukaemia. And among the chaos of his house, they find a document written by Art, The Book of Hidden Things, that promises to reveal dark secrets and wonders beyond anything previously known.<br><br>Francesco Dimitri's first novel written in English, following his career as one of the most significant fantasy writers in Italy, will entrance fans of Elena Ferrante, Neil Gaiman and Donna Tartt. Set in the beguiling and seductive landscape of Southern Italy, this story is about friendship and landscape, love and betrayal; above all it is about the nature of mystery itself.</p><p>Francesco Dimitri is an Italian magic realist author living in London, a business story-teller, and a lifetime searcher for wonder. He has written in many different forms (nonfiction, fiction, comics, cinema, digital media, essays, magazines) and worked for top business clients. In his quest for wonder he has shot documentaries about UFO cults, slept deep into the forests of Transylvania, conversed with mathematicians, artists, chefs, psychologists, stage magicians, and strangers in crowds."In lesser hands, this blend of detective story, organized crime thriller, and supernatural investigation would feel like a grab bag of plot devices, but Dimitri has created a thrilling spectacle that also manages to point poignantly at the way the landscapes we grow up in shape us in ways even beyond our understanding. A deeply felt look at the idea of home, clothed as a popcornworthy page-turner." - Kirkus Reviews (starred review)<br><br>"An evocative meditation on friendship, adulthood, and the liminal spaces that lie just outside human perception...Dimitri&#x2019;s beautifully written tale, steeped in nostalgia, folklore, and religion, will enthrall and terrify readers." - Publishers Weekly<br><br>"A mystifying exploration of unbelief and faith, Francesco Dimitri&#x2019;s The Book of Hidden Things dazzles with portraits of men at a crossroads...

Tokitsu has spent most of his life researching the legendary samurai swordsman and his works, and in this book he illuminates this seminal text, along with several other works by Musashi. These include &#x201c;The Mirror of the Way of Strategy,&#x201d; which Musashi wrote when he was in his twenties; &#x201c;Thirty-five Instructions on Strategy,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Forty-two Instructions on Strategy,&#x201d; which were precursors to <i>The Book of Five Rings;</i> and &#x201c;The Way to Be Followed Alone,&#x201d; which Musashi wrote just days before his death. Read together, these five texts give readers an unusually detailed, nuanced view of Musashi&#x2019;s ideas on swordsmanship, strategy, and self-cultivation. <br><br>Tokitsu puts all these writings into historical and philosophical context and makes them accessible and relevant to today&#x2019;s readers and martial arts students.

But at 24, she started dabbling in meth in San Francisco and unleashed a fiendish addiction monster. Soon, if you could snort it, smoke it, or have sex with it, she did. <br><br>Thus began a spiral that eventually landed her in the psych ward--and then penniless, divorced, and looking at 240 hours of court-ordered community service. For two years, assigned to a Hollywood Boulevard "chain gang," she swept up syringes (and worse) as she bounced from rehabs to halfway houses, all while struggling with sobriety, sex addiction, and starting over in her forties.

All these behaviors are linked to physical changes and growth in the adolescent brain. Ten years ago, there was no Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat. Now every kid has a smartphone and a Twitter account. Award-winning psychologist Dr. David Walsh has now updated his 2004 classic with the most current research into the adolescent brain, and he&#x2019;s also updated his guidance for parents and teens on navigating the new challenges of the 24/7 online world.<br> <br>With real-life stories and reassuring guidance, Walsh provides realistic solutions for dealing with everyday and major challenges. Sample dialogues help teens and parents talk civilly and constructively with one another; behavioral contracts and Parental Survival Kits provide practical advice for dealing with issues like curfews, disrespectful language and actions, and bullying. As a parent, psychologist, coach, and trusted expert, Dr. Walsh offers the best advice to help adolescents thrive and parents survive.</p><p>"Dr. Walsh is a teacher, scientist, therapist, and parent and all of these roles enable him to deliver a powerful, practical book on the teenage brain. Usually when I study the brain, my eyes cross and I fall asleep, but Walsh is a storyteller with the gifts of simplicity and clarity. This book is an easy read, but its message is fresh, nuanced, and important. I recommend it to all parents who ask themselves, 'Why do they act this way?'" <br>--Mary Pipher, Ph.D., author, Reviving Ophelia <p>"Teenagers...those baffling and scary creatures your adorable kids turned into, leaving you puzzled and angry all the time. Dave Walsh's weaving together of current understanding of the teenage brain with years of clinical experience with teens has produced a thoughtful, practical and down-to-earth guide that enables parents to understand and deal well with their teenager. If you are struggling with your adolescent, or even anticipating your child's entrance into those crazy years, this book will show you why it all makes sense and how to help both you and your teen have the healthiest, sanest passage."<br>--Gail Saltz, M.D., Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, The New York Presbyterian Hospital; Today Show Mental Health Contributor; Author of Becoming Real </p><p>"Why Do They Act That Way is a comprehensive guide to the biology behind just about every adolescent behavior a parent or teacher might encounter. Drawing from his extensive clinical experience, Dr. Walsh walks the reader through many situations he has helped resolve through an understanding of how teen brains grow and develop. His gentle humor and friendly exploration of some personal parenting mishaps make this a highly readable and helpful book. You'll finish it feeling as if you've just had coffee with someone who is not only entertaining and enlightening but who knows exactly how it feels to be the mom or dad of a twenty first century teen." <br>--Cheryl Dellasega, Ph.D., Author of Surviving Ophelia, GirlWars (with Charisse Nixon), and Stung!

Protected by supernatural forces, these sacred scrolls could be uncovered only by a special seeker, one who fulfills the ancient prophecy of <i>l'attendue</i> -- The Expected One. <br> <br> When journalist Maureen Paschal begins the research for a new book, she has no idea that she is stepping into an ancient mystery so secret, so revolutionary, that thousands of people have killed and died for it. She becomes deeply immersed in the mystical cultures of southwest France as the eerie prophecy of The Expected One casts a shadow over her life and work and a long-buried family secret comes to light. Ultimately she, and the reader, come face-to-face with Jesus Christ, Mary Magdalene, John the Baptist, Judas, and Salome in the pages of a deeply moving and powerful new gospel, the life of Jesus as told by Mary Magdalene. <br> <br> CONTAINS NEW, UNPUBLISHED MATERIAL FROM THE ARQUES GOSPEL</p><p><b>Kathleen McGowan</b> is an internationally published writer whose work has appeared on five continents and in at least fifteen languages. She lives in Los Angeles with her husband and three sons. You can visit her website at www.theexpectedone.com.This title shares a similarity of subject matter with THE DA VINCI CODE--the possibility of a Gospel written by Christ's wife and apostle, Mary Magdalene. But THE EXPECTED ONE takes a different approach. As read by Linda Emond, this story of a Magdalene descendant, writer Maureen Paschal, is certainly a spiritual quest. But it deals with the inner lives of the characters rather than focusing on a physical search for evidence. Emond's approach is low-key; her command of accents (American, French, Scots, Italian, and Irish) is never permitted to upstage the characters. The author's claim to be a Magdalene descendant and her afterword add further interest.

In this second book about the twins, the girls are yet again only distinguishable because one has blue buttons on her dress and the other has red. It is in these tiny details that Doi excels. The use of color pencils to masterfully guide readers on a leisurely paced tour is reminiscent of days gone by. "Dring-dring, dring-dring!" goes the bicycles, and magically the twins become tiny. They follow a bee to eat a delicious honey cake, flower chafers to drink juice made of "yumberry fruit and raspberry pulp," a lizard to eat fluorite candies, and finally fireflies back to their own house. Doi creates an enchanted world that harkens back to a quieter time. There is never any sense of danger or anxiety, either in the artwork or in the spare poetic text. Through pacing and a soft-focus lens, pale cream-colored pages in a small rectangular format, and the bleed over onto the next page, Doi sets the tone of a gentle read. Nature is celebrated in a bucolic setting. In this dollhouse come to life, children will enjoy picking hidden surprises out from the illustratons. This book is best enjoyed one-on-one, so readers can luxuriate in the artistic nuances. Careful observers will notice that the endpapers serve as a map for the twins' journey. VERDICT A highly recommended purchase for any size collection where readers will delight in the whimsical nostalgic artwork.&#x2014;Eva Thaler-Sroussi, Glencoe Public Library, IL</p><h2>Ten Million Steps: Nimblewill Nomad&#39;s Epic 10-Month Trek from the Florida Keys to Qu�bec</h2><p>M. J. Eberhart, aka the Nimblewill Nomad, was a 60-year-old retired doctor in January 1998 when he set off on a foot journey that carried him 4,400 miles (twice the length of the Appalachian Trail) from the Florida Keys to the far north of Quebec. Written in a vivid journal style, the author unabashedly recounts the good (friendships with other hikers he met), the bad (sore legs, cutting winds and rain), and the godawful (those dispiriting doubts) aspects of his days of walking along what has since become known as the Eastern Continental Trail (ECT). An amazing tale of self-discovery and insight into the magic that reverberates from intense physical exertion and a high goal, Eberhart&#x2019;s is the only written account of a thru-hike along the ECT. Covering 16 states and 2 Canadian provinces, <i>Ten Million Steps</i> deftly mixes practical considerations of an almost unimaginable undertaking with the author&#x2019;s trademark humor and philosophical musings.</p><p></p><h2>Katie and the Waterlily Pond</h2><p><p><b>Make art an adventure with classic picture book character, Katie, in this wonderful introduction to some of Monet's best-known paintings.</b></p><p>Katie desperately wants to win the art competition at the gallery.

Can you find it? Two kids set off on an adventure away from their urban home and discover all the beauty of the natural world. From the bark on the trees to the sudden storm that moves across the sky to fire and flowers, and snowflakes and fresh fruit. As the children make their way through the woods and back to the paved and noisy streets, they discover that wild exists not just off in some distant place, but right in their own backyard.</p><p>Megan Wagner Lloyd lives in Washington DC with her family.

Emerging from the subway, two children travel through fields, forests, mountains, and meadows, exploring the many pleasures to be found outdoors. Evocative language encourages the use of all five senses when journeying through the landscape. "Wild is full of smells&#x2014;fresh mint, ancient cave, sun-baked desert, sharp pine, salt sea. Every scent begging you to drink it in." City dwellers are emboldened to seek out and investigate nature hiding amid the buildings and streets, as the children return home and discover an urban oasis. Multitextured digitally finished watercolor and pencil illustrations portray the varieties of nature, from a tiny sprout and shiny spiderweb to a lakeside trail and a pack of baying wolves. Colorful spreads provide space to feel the grandeur of the environment. VERDICT In an age when children spend less and less time outside, this ode to the wonder of the natural world is a step in the right direction. Perfect for a city-critters or nature unit.&#x2014;Teri Markson, Los Angeles Public Library</p><h2>The Anxiety Cure</h2><p><p>Panic Anxiety is the number one mental health problem for women and second only to drug abuse among men.

F. Schumacher explores our relation to the world: our obligations&#x2014;to other people, to the earth, to progress and technology, but most importantly to ourselves. If man can fulfill these obligations, then and only then can he enjoy a truly authentic relationship with the world&#x2014;and truly know the meaning of living.</p><p>Schumacher argues that we need maps: a "map of knowledge" and a "map of living." The concern of the mapmaker is to find for everything its proper place. For things out of place tend to get lost; they become invisible and their proper places are filled by other things that should not be there at all and therefore serve to mislead.</p><p><em>A Guide for the Perplexed</em> teaches us to be our own map makers in following our destined path in life&#x2019;s journey.</p></p><p><p>An inspired critique of modern materialistic values and a road map for achieving one's true, higher potential from "one of the wisest minds of our time."*</p><p>"This is what my life has been leading to," said the maverick economist E. F. Schumacher upon completing <em>A Guide for the Perplexed</em>, his summation of a lifetime of wisdom. The author of the classic <em>Small Is Beautiful</em>, the "eco bible" (<em>Time</em>) named one of the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em>'s 100 Most Influential Books Since World War II, Schumacher charts the failings of "materialistic scientism," the system of thought that dominates the developed world and which Schumacher charges with narrowing the horizons of human experience. Instead, he seeks to offer a new, far more expansive "map for living" that liberates our goals beyond the constraints of logic and inspires in us the faith to choose a life of higher significance. "Our ordinary mind always tries to persuade us that we are nothing but acorns," he writes, "but that is of interest only to pigs. Our faith gives us something much better: that we can become oak trees."</p><p>Born in Germany, Dr. E. F. Schumacher (1911&#x2013;1977) fled to England after the rise of Nazism and, with the help of John Maynard Keynes, taught economics at Oxford University.

LeBlanc lives in Manhattan.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br>Jessica lived on Tremont Avenue, on one of the poorer blocks in a very poor section of the Bronx. She dressed even to go to the store. Chance was opportunity in the ghetto, and you had to be prepared for anything. She didn't have much of a wardrobe, but she was resourceful with what she had -- her sister's Lee jeans, her best friend's earrings, her mother's T-shirts and perfume. Her appearance on the streets in her neighborhood usually caused a stir. A sixteen-year-old Puerto Rican girl with bright hazel eyes, a huge, inviting smile, and a voluptuous shape, she radiated intimacy wherever she went. You could be talking to her in the middle of the bustle of Tremont and feel as if lovers' confidences were being exchanged beneath a tent of sheets. Guys in cars offered rides. Grown men got stupid. Women pursed their lips. Boys made promises they could not keep.<br><br>Jessica was good at attracting boys, but less good at holding on to them. She fell in love hard and fast. She desperately wanted to be somebody's real girlfriend, but she always ended up the other girl, the mistress, the one they saw on the down-low, the girl nobody claimed. Boys called up to her window after they'd dropped off their main girls, the steady ones they referred to as wives. Jessica still had her fun, but her fun was somebody else's trouble, and for a wild girl at the dangerous age, the trouble could get big.<br><br>It was the mideighties, and the drug trade on East Tremont was brisk. The avenue marks the north end of the South Bronx, running east to west. Jessica lived just off the Grand Concourse, which bisects the Bronx lengthwise. Her mother's tenement apartment overlooked an underpass. Car stereos thudded and Spanish radio tunes wafted down from windows. On corners, boys stood draped in gold bracelets and chains. Children munched on the takeout that the dealers bought them, balancing the styrofoam trays of greasy food on their knees. Grandmothers pushed strollers. Young mothers leaned on strollers they'd parked so they could concentrate on flirting, their irresistible babies providing excellent introductions and much-needed entertainment. All along the avenue, working people shopped and dragged home bags of groceries, or pushed wheelcarts of meticulously folded laundry. Drug customers wound through the crowd, copped, and skulked away again. The streets that loosely bracketed Jessica's world -- Tremont and Anthony, Anthony and Echo, Mount Hope and Anthony, Mount Hope and Monroe -- were some of the hottest drug-dealing blocks in the notorious 46th Precinct.<br><br>The same stretch of Tremont had been good to Jessica's family. Lourdes, Jessica's mother, had moved from Manhattan with a violent boyfriend, hoping the Bronx might give the troubled relationship a fresh start. That relationship soon ended, but a new place still meant possibility. One afternoon, Jessica stopped by Ultra Fine Meats for Lourdes and the butcher asked her out. Jessica was fourteen at the time; he was twenty-five. Jessica replied that she was too young for him but that her thirty-two-year-old mother was pretty and available. It took the butcher seven tries before Lourdes agreed to a date. Two months later, he moved in. The children called him Big Daddy.<br><br>Almost immediately, the household resumed a schedule: Lourdes prepared Big Daddy's breakfast and sent him off to work; everyone -- Robert, Jessica, Elaine, and Cesar -- went to school; Lourdes cleaned house and had the evening meal cooked and waiting on the stove by noon. Big Daddy seemed to love Lourdes. On weekends, he took her bowling, dancing, or out to City Island for dinner. And he accepted her four children. He bought them clothes, invited them to softball games, and drove them upstate for picnics at Bear Mountain. He behaved as though they were a family.<br><br>Jessica and her older brother, Robert, had the same father, who had died when Jessica was three, but he had never accepted Jessica as his; now only Robert maintained a close relationship with the father's relatives. Elaine, Jessica's younger sister, had her own father, whom she sometimes visited on weekends. Cesar's father accepted him -- Cesar had his last name on his birth certificate -- but he was a drug dealer with other women and other kids. Occasionally he passed by Lourdes's; sometimes Cesar went to stay with him, and during those visits, Cesar would keep him company on the street. Cesar's father put him to work: "Here," he would say, passing Cesar vials of crack taped together, "hold this." Drug charges didn't stick to children, but Big Daddy cautioned Cesar about the lifestyle when he returned home. "Don't follow his lead. If anybody's lead you gonna follow, it should be mine." Big Daddy spoke to Cesar's teachers when Cesar had problems in school. Jessica considered Big Daddy a stepfather, an honor she had not bestowed upon any other of her mother's men. But even Jessica's and Cesar's affection for Big Daddy could not keep them inside.<br><br>* * *<br><br>For Jessica, love was the most interesting place to go and beauty was the ticket. She gravitated toward the enterprising boys, the boys with money, who were mostly the ones dealing drugs -- purposeful boys who pushed out of the bodega's smudged doors as if they were stepping into a party instead of onto a littered sidewalk along a potholed street. Jessica sashayed onto the pavement with a similar readiness whenever she descended the four flights of stairs from the apartment and emerged, expectant and smiling, from the paint-chipped vestibule. Lourdes thought that Jessica was a dreamer: "She always wanted to have a king with a maid. I always told her, 'That's only in books. Face reality.' Her dream was more upper than herself." Lourdes would caution her daughter as she disappeared down the dreary stairwell, "God ain't gonna have a pillow waiting for your ass when you fall landing from the sky."<br><br>Outside, Jessica believed, anything could happen. Usually, though, not much did. She would go off in search of one of her boyfriends, or disappear with Lillian, one of her best friends. Her little brother, Cesar, would run around the neighborhood, antagonizing the other children he half-wanted as friends. Sometimes Jessica would cajole slices of pizza for Cesar from her dates. Her seductive ways instructed him. "My sister was smart," Cesar said. "She used me like a decoy, so if a guy got mad at her, he would still come around to take me out. 'Here's my little brother,' she would say. 'Take him with you.'" More often, though, Cesar got left behind. He would sit on the broken steps of his mother's building, biding his time, watching the older boys who ruled the street.<br><br>Jessica considered Victor a boyfriend, and she'd visit him on Echo Place, where he sold crack and weed. Victor saw other girls, though, and Jessica was open to other opportunities. One day in the fall of 1984, when she should have been in school, she and Lillian went to a toga party on 187th and Crotona Avenue. The two friends were known at the hooky house on Crotona. The girls would shadow the boys on their way to the handball courts or kill time at White Castle burgers, and everyone often ended up in the basement room. The building was officially abandoned, but the kids had made a home there. They'd set up old sofas along one wall, and on another they'd arranged a couple of beds. There was always a DJ scratching records. The boys practiced break dancing on an old carpet and lifted weights. The girls had little to do but watch the boys or primp in front of the salvaged mirrors propped beside a punching bag. At the toga party, Jessica and Lillian entered one of the makeshift bedrooms to exchange their clothes for sheets. Two older boys named Puma and Chino followed them. The boys told the girls that they were pretty, and that their bodies looked beautiful with or without sheets. As a matter of fact, they said, instead of joining the party, why don't we just stay right here?<br><br>Puma dealt drugs, but he was no ordinary boy. He had appeared in <i>Beat Street,</i> a movie that chronicled the earliest days of hip-hop from the perspective of the inner-city kids who'd created it. The film, which would become a cult classic, portrayed self-expression as essential to survival, along with mothers, friends, money, music, and food. <i>Beat Street</i> showcased some Bronx talent, including Puma's group, the Rock Steady Crew. Puma had cinematic presence, and he was a remarkable break-dancer, but when he met Jessica his career was sliding to the bottom of its brief slope of success. The international tour that had taken him to Australia and Japan was over, and the tuxedo he'd worn break dancing for the queen of England hung in a closet in its dry-cleaning bag. He'd spent all the money he had earned on clothes and sneakers and fleets of mopeds for his friends.<br><br>Jessica was glad for anybody's attention, but she was especially flattered by Puma's. He was a celebrity. He performed solo for her. He was clever, and his antic behavior made her laugh. One thing led to another, and next thing you know, Jessica and Puma were kissing on top of a pile of coats. Similar things were happening between Lillian and Chino on another bed.<br><br>Both girls came out pregnant. Jessica assured her mother that the father was her boyfriend, Victor, but there was no way to be certain. The following May, Jessica and Lillian dropped out of ninth grade. They gave birth to baby girls four days apart, in the summer of 1985. Big Daddy clasped Jessica's hand through her delivery. At one point, Jessica bit him so hard that she drew blood. The grandfather scar made Big Daddy proud.<br><br>Jessica named her daughter Serena Josephine. Lourdes promptly proclaimed her Little Star. It was understood that Lourdes would have to raise her; Jessica didn't have the patience. Even if she hadn't been young, and moody, Jessica wasn't the mothering kind. Lourdes wasn't, either -- in fact, she wished she'd never had children -- but circumstance had eroded her active resistance to the role. She'd been raising children since she was six. First, she'd watched her own four siblings while her mother worked double shifts at a garment factory in Hell's Kitchen. She'd fought their neighborhood fights. She'd fed them and bathed them and put them to bed. Now Lourdes's own four, whom she had been able to manage when they were little, were teenagers slipping beyond her reach.<br><br>Robert and Elaine had been easy, but Lourdes felt their fathers' families were turning them into snobs. Robert returned from his weekend visits with his grandmother smoldering with righteousness. Lourdes could tell he disapproved of her involvement with Santeria, but who was her son to judge? How holy had it been, when Jessica was pregnant, for Robert to chase her around the apartment, threatening to beat her up? Her daughter Elaine's arrogance occupied a more worldly terrain. On Sunday nights, she alighted from her father's yellow cab, prim in her new outfits, and turned up her cute nose at the clothes Lourdes had brought home from the dollar store.<br><br>Jessica and Cesar were Lourdes's favorites, but they ignored her advice and infuriated her regularly. When Lourdes stuck her head out of the living room window overlooking Tremont and called her children in for supper (she used the whistle from the sound track of the movie <i>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly),</i> she was usually calling for Jessica and Cesar; Robert and Elaine were apt to be at home. Robert and Elaine worried about getting into trouble, whereas Jessica and Cesar had as much fun as they possibly could until trouble inevitably hit. Robert and Elaine were dutiful students. Jessica and Cesar were smart, but undisciplined. Jessica cut classes. Cesar sprinted through his work, then found it impossible to sit still; once, he'd jumped out of his second-story classroom window after Lourdes had physically dragged him around the corner to school.<br><br>Jessica and Cesar also looked out for each other. One night, Jessica went missing and Lourdes found out that she had been with an off-duty cop in a parked car; when Lourdes kicked Jessica in the head so hard that her ear bled, it was Cesar who ran to the hospital for help. Another time, during an electrical fire, Jessica ushered Cesar to the safety of the fire escape. Jessica knew how to appease Lourdes's brooding with cigarettes and her favorite chocolate bead candy. Cesar, however, had fewer resources at his disposal. He had learned to steel himself against his mother's beatings. By the time he was eleven, when his niece Little Star was born, Cesar didn't cry no matter how hard Lourdes hit.<br><br>For Lourdes, Little Star's arrival was like new love, or the coming of spring. As far as she was concerned, that little girl was hers. "When I pulled that baby out -- Jessica was there -- the eyes!" Lourdes said. "The eyes speak faster than the mouth. The eyes come from the heart." A baby was trustworthy. Little Star would listen to Lourdes and mind her; she would learn from Lourdes's mistakes. Little Star would love her grandmother with the unquestioning loyalty Lourdes felt she deserved but didn't get from her ungrateful kids.<br><br>Meanwhile, Jessica made the most of her ambiguous situation. She told Victor that he was the father: she and Victor cared for one another and he had attended the delivery; he also gave Jessica money for Little Star's first Pampers, although his other girlfriend was pregnant, too. Secretly, however, Jessica hoped that Puma was the father, and she was also telling him that the baby was his. Puma was living with a girl named Trinket, who was pregnant, and whom he referred to as his wife; he also had another baby by Victor's girlfriend's sister. Despite the formidable odds, Jessica hoped for a future with him.<br><br>Publicly, Puma insisted Little Star was not his. But she certainly looked like his: she had the same broad forehead, and that wide gap between her dot-brown eyes. The day Jessica came home with a videotape of the movie Beat Street, Lourdes had heard enough about this break-dancing Puma to go on alert. She settled on her bed with Little Star, Jessica, Elaine, and their dog, Scruffy. In one of the early scenes of the film, a boy who looked suspiciously like Little Star did a speedy break dance at a hooky house. Then he challenged a rival crew to a battle at the Roxy, a popular club.<br><br>"Hold that pause," shouted Lourdes. "That's Little Star's father! I will cut my pussy off and give it to that dog if that ain't Little Star's father!" Jessica laughed, pleased at the recognition. Puma could say what he liked, but blood will out.<br><br>Puma's confidante was a short, stocky tomboy named Milagros. Milagros had known Puma forever and considered him family. Puma was the first boy she'd ever kissed. Kissing boys no longer interested Milagros. Puma's stories of Jessica's sexual escapades, however, intrigued her; Milagros had noticed Jessica as well, when they both attended Roosevelt High School. Milagros knew that Puma still saw Jessica, but she kept it to herself. Meanwhile, Milagros and Puma's live-in girlfriend, Trinket, were becoming friends.<br><br>Milagros and Trinket made an unlikely duo. If a river ran through the styles of poor South Bronx girlhood, these two camped on opposite banks. Milagros, who never wore makeup, tugged her dull brown hair into a pull-back and stuck to what she called "the simple look" -- T-shirts, sneakers, jeans. Trinket slathered on lipstick, painted rainbows of eye shadow on the lids of her green eyes, and teased her auburn hair into a lion's mane. Trinket was looking forward to becoming a mother, whereas Milagros proclaimed, loudly and often, her tiny nostrils flaring, that she would never have children and end up slaving to a man.<br><br>In the fall of 1985, some of Jessica's friends r...</p><h2>Federal Income Tax (Examples &amp; Explanations)</h2><p><p>A favorite classroom prep tool of successful students that is often recommended by professors, the <strong>Examples &amp; Explanations </strong>(E&amp;E) series provides an alternative perspective to help you understand your casebook and in-class lectures.

What ensues is a playful exploration of sound and the vast (and cacophonous) world of musical instruments. The boy's overwhelmed parents follow him as he tries out the triangle, trombone, tuba, harp, and drums and everything else in between. Barton's use of superlatives results in a hilarious onomatopoeic romp through the shop: "Do I pick the squeeziest? The wheeziest? The easiest and breeziest? But how about the slideyest...the squonkiest...the blowiest...?" The work's title might give away the child's eventual pick, but readers will have a fun time arriving at his final decision. While at first overwhelmed at having to master the 88 keys of the piano, the boy is determined to learn one note at a time. Thomas's watercolor illustrations accentuate the silly narrative, adding pizzazz and fluidity to the text. The warm browns and yellows evoke a place of comfort&#x2014;while the narrator is frazzled by his plethora of selections, he's secure in his ability to eventually choose. The illustrator's expressive line emphasizes each of the characters' reactions with humor and gusto.

Lincoln was asked to memorialize the gruesome battle. Instead he gave the whole nation &#x201c;a new birth of freedom&#x201d; in the space of a mere 272 words. His entire life and previous training and his deep political experience went into this, his revolutionary masterpiece.<br> <br>By examining both the address and Lincoln in their historical moment and cultural frame, Wills breathes new life into words we thought we knew, and reveals much about a president so mythologized but often misunderstood. Wills shows how Lincoln came to change the world and to effect an intellectual revolution, how his words had to and did complete the work of the guns, and how Lincoln wove a spell that has not yet been broken.</p><p><b>Garry Wills</b> is an Emeritus Professor of History at Northwestern University. Born in Atlanta in 1934, he has taught widely throughout the United States. A prolific writer and scholar, Wills is the author of more than twenty books, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>Lincoln at Gettysburg, Papal Sin</i>, and <i>What Jesus Meant</i>. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><i>Oratory of the Greek Revival</i><br><br>James Hurt says that Lincoln used "the ordinary coin of funeral oratory" at Gettysburg. Insofar as there was a standard coinage of funeral tribute, Pericles struck the master coin 2,394 years before Lincoln spoke. At the end of the first year of Athens' war with Sparta, Pericles gave a speech over the ashes of the Athenians who had fallen in that year. Thucydides put a version of that speech in his history of the Peloponnesian War, and it became the most famous oration of its kind, a model endlessly copied, praised, and cited -- especially in the early nineteenth century, during America's Greek Revival.<br><br>Edward Everett lost no time referring to that speech at Gettysburg. He opened his talk with a detailed description of the annual funeral rite at which Pericles had spoken, comparing it point for point with the ceremony for the Union dead. Both rites involved <i>re</i>burial. Athenian soldiers or sailors were cremated where they fell, then their ashes were returned to Athens and buried, together, on the annual day of military tribute. They were buried by tribe, with a special place for those whose tribes could not be identified -- as the Union dead were buried by states, except for those "unknown soldiers" who had their own special place.<br><br>But at Gettysburg the reburial was still at the battle site. The ancient parallel for this, Everett was learned enough to know, was the Battle of Marathon (490 B.C.E.), after which the Athenians were buried on the spot where they had saved Hellas from the Persians.<br><br>These references, common enough at the time, all had a special meaning for Everett, considered by some the new Pericles for a young democracy of the Western world. Ralph Waldo Emerson, who studied Greek at Harvard in Everett's classroom, was emphatic in his teacher's praise: "There was an influence on the young from the genius of Everett which was almost comparable to that of Pericles in Athens."<br><br>America as a second Athens was an idea whose moment had come in the nineteenth century. This nation's founders first looked to Rome, not to Greece, for their model. Like most men of the eighteenth century, they thought of Athens as ruled by mobs. If any Greek city was admired, it was Sparta, whose discipline inspired the severe moralists of the early Roman republic. The "mixed government" of Rome -- not Athens' direct democracy -- was the model invoked in debates over the proper constitution for the United States. The great republican of the new era, George Washington, was regularly referred to as a modern Cincinnatus, after the Roman who left the plow to serve the republic and then returned to his fields, relinquishing power. When Jefferson laid out the plan for his University of Virginia, he fashioned everything to Roman architectural standards.<br><br>All this changed very rapidly as the eighteenth turned to the nineteenth century. Archaeology in Greece brought the ancient democracy to mind just as modern Greece began its struggle for freedom from the Turks. Greece would prove as important to the romantic movement as Rome had been to the Augustan age. Byron died as a military participant in the war for Greek liberty. Shelley wrote a <i>Prometheus.</i> Keats rhapsodized on a Grecian urn. H�lderlin and the German romantics composed plays and poems on Greek themes. Architects looked to the Parthenon now, not the Pantheon. (The Elgin Marbles, taken from the Parthenon, had been moved to London by 1806.) It is significant of this changed taste that Washington completed his inherited home (as Jefferson conceived his own house) in the form of a Roman villa, while Lincoln's additions to the house he purchased were in the Greek Revival style. This was a "democratic" style in the eyes of Lincoln's contemporaries:<br><br>Thomas Jefferson's brief and highly personal Roman Revival was the product of an individual mind; the Greek Revival was the product of a popular sentiment. The fact that it became expressive for the whole of American society, from the erudite to the untutored, from the capital to the village, from the city house to the farm, gave it a national independence and set it apart from the architecture of Europe in a way and to a degree that American builders had never before achieved. Indeed, at no time in the history of Western man had a single stylistic form, however sentimentally conceived, been so spontaneously accepted by a total society. It is in this sense that the Greek Revival must be understood as America's first national style of architecture.<br><br>Everett played a key role in America's Greek Revival. Harvard established its new chair of ancient Greek studies for him. He had sped through Harvard at the top of his class, completed his divinity studies, and been appointed to the prestigious Brattle Street pulpit before he was twenty. His promise as a scholar made Harvard call him back from the pulpit to the classroom. But first the university subsidized his studies in Germany, where he was the first American to earn his doctorate at a center of the new philology (in 1817, from G�ttingen). While Everett was abroad, he traveled widely and met the leaders of the romantic age, from Goethe to Byron. He went to Greece, to walk over the battlefields where the first democracy of the West won its freedom. He returned to America convinced that a new Athens was rising here.<br><br>This was a vision he found it hard to keep alive while teaching teenagers their Greek verb forms? His earlier success in the pulpit made him think he could accomplish in the secular sphere what the ancient orators had in the Greek marketplace, groves, and public cemetery (Agora, Akademy, and Kerameikos). He was confirmed in this sense of vocation in 1825, the year of Lafayette's visit to America. That return occasioned one of this country's great outpourings of romantic feeling. Here was a warrior from the age of General Washington surviving into the age of Byron. His appearances prompted rallies for Greek independence -- a favorite cause of Everett. At Cambridge, Lafayette was treated to a long oration by Everett, devoted to the role of literature in America. The response was almost as great as the response to the speech Daniel Webster addressed to Lafayette, across the Charles River, in Boston. Everett's own talk propelled him into the political arena -- as congressman, Massachusetts governor, minister to the Court of St. James's in London, senator (after an interval as president of Harvard), and secretary of state. But, all along, his public lecturing remained the most satisfying part of what he considered an essentially pedagogic career. Webster's orations were an offshoot of his role as statesman and legislator; but Everett, in effect, ran for and held office in order to attract an audience for his speeches.<br><br>He was always a teacher. He had merely traded the classroom for the stump. And his students followed him out into this wider world. Emerson made the public lecture his own main art form, launching his career with the 1837 address on the modern scholar as Everett had launched himself in the 1825 talk on American letters. Everett was a model to Emerson and the other Transcendentalists because he was so clearly a scholar before he became a popularizer of democratic ideals. Emerson's experience in Everett's classroom gave an entirely new direction to his life:<br><br>Germany had created [literary] criticism in vain for us until 1820, when Edward Everett returned from his five years in Europe, and brought to Cambridge his rich results, which no one was so fitted by natural grace and the splendor of his rhetoric to introduce and recommend. He made us for the first time acquainted with [Friedrich August] Wolf's theory of the Homeric writings, with the criticism of [Heinrich] Heine. The novelty of the learning lost nothing in the skill and genius of its interpreter, and the rudest undergraduate found a new morning opening to him in the lecture room at Harvard.<br><br>Emerson's mention of the philologist Wolf struck an ominous note for orthodox Calvinists of New England. By tracing multiple authorship in Homer, Wolf had encouraged a similar approach to the other main text of a "heroic age," calling into question Moses's authorship of the Pentateuch. Transcendentalists like Emerson and Theodore Parker would abandon or alter Christian tenets to accommodate this "higher criticism." The other name Emerson mentioned, that of the lyric poet Heine, suggests a different side of Homer, one that would also be important in the romantic period. Homer, who was thought of as wild and natural, held a relation to the polished Roman poets, like Virgil, roughly resembling that of Wordsworth to Alexander Pope.<br><br>Everett's immense prestige sent others to G�ttingen for German learning, including the historian George Bancroft, whose lecture on progress Lincoln would later imitate. Bancroft intended to study ancient languages at G�ttingen, for interpreting the Bible, but he feared no pulpit would welcome a "higher critic." He moved on to Berlin, where he acquired his personal Transcendentalism from the philosopher Friedrich Schleiermacher. But his main interest was Greek history. After his return to America, he set up a preparatory school to imitate on our soil the methods of educational reformer J. H. Pestalozzi, which he had observed in the German Gymnasium. During his teaching years, he translated from German some works of his G�ttingen professor Arnold H. L. Heeren. These included <i>Ancient Greece,</i> a history that Harvard accepted as a textbook.<br><br>Heeren's book, which glorified the Periclean age, shows how far romantic historiography had moved from the picture of Athens as anarchical. Bancroft was ahead of the wave of histories that would glorify Periclean Athens in Victorian England. Direct democracy, a flawed system in republican theory, was rehabilitated, for its usefulness in the parliamentary reform movement, by British historians like George Grote. In America, a similar motion toward government <i>by</i> the people, not just <i>for</i> the republic, was signaled by an enthusiasm for Greek symbols. Bancroft became a Jacksonian Democrat when he began to apply the historical skills formed on the Attic democracy to America's development. Walter Savage Landor recognized what was happening in America when he dedicated the second volume of his <i>Pericles and Aspasia</i> to President Andrew Jackson.<br><br>It was as the voice of a fashionably romantic Hellenism that Everett became famous. This is what led people to turn naturally toward him when the Gettysburg cemetery was to be dedicated -- as it had, earlier, led New England orators to imitate the Greek idea of popular debate and instruction. Perry Miller describes Everett's impact on the most influential philosophical school of his period:<br><br>No account of Transcendentalism is ever comprehensible unless it includes a consideration of what seemed, during the 1820s, the unearthly magic of his [Everett's] eloquence. If the whole group, and especially Emerson, were committed to the belief that oratory is among the supreme manifestations of art, they were persuaded not only by such forensic giants as Webster and Clay, but more particularly by Everett, who was one of their own kind. Here at last was a New England scholar who appeared the master of all that European culture could offer, who in native terms made articulate, in a style that could compete with Burke and Pitt and Sheridan, everything that America held precious.<br><br>Emerson, who was always ready to pay his debt to the influence of Everett, learned to tighten his own public speeches toward a knottier classicism than Everett's diffuse speeches exhibited. Emerson represented the next step in the modern use of classical rhetoric -- and it was a step in the direction of the Gettysburg Address itself. Emerson uses antithesis, aphorism, the nervous rhythms of a quickening time. It is no wonder that Emerson admired Lincoln's speech at Gettysburg more than that of his old master: "His brief speech at Gettysburg will not easily be surpassed by words on any recorded occasion." But, in forming the idem of modern democratic speech that gave us Emerson, Everett had helped create the very conditions that brought forth Lincoln's demotic oratory. Everett's classicism was as much the forerunner of Lincoln's talk as its foil or contrast.<br><br>The classicism of Everett's opening references at Gettysburg should not be taken as mere antiquarian reverence for the past. Everett had always opposed any fetishism of the classics. In his speech on the Battle of Concord (1825), he said:<br><br>Are we to be eternally ringing the changes upon Marathon and Thermopylae; and going back to find in obscure texts of Greek and Latin the great exemplars of patriotic virtue?...We feel a glow of admiration at the heroism displayed at Marathon, by the ten thousand champions of invaded Greece; but we cannot forget that the tenth part of the number were slaves, unchained from the workshops and doorposts of their masters, to go and fight the battles of freedom. I do not mean that these examples are to destroy the interest with which we read the history of ancient times; they possibly increase that interest, by the singular <i>contrast</i> they exhibit. But they do warn us, if we need the warning, to seek our great practical lessons of patriotism at <i>home;</i> out of the exploits and sacrifices of which our <i>own</i> country is the theatre; out of the character of our <i>own</i> fathers. [Italics added.]<br><br>But, like a good student of Germany's "higher critics," Everett held that certain large themes are only traceable in history's <i>process,</i> and a vision of long stretches of time is needed to grasp and advance those themes. Transcendentalism looked to the progressive realization of ideals implicit in ancient art. Everett felt that popular awareness of these ideals could be kept alive by a reverence for the "holy places" of freedom, democracy, and eloquence. Speaking in 1833 to commemorate the Battle of Bunker Hill, Everett urged the citizens of Boston to raise the funds for completing their monument, not trusting to time for the preservation of a site sacred to liberty. He described how "I have searched in vain for the narrow pass [Thermopylae] between the foot of the mountain and the sea. It is gone." He compares, at Gettysburg, his tracing of the battle's course on Pennsylvania fields to his student days at Marathon. That is what made him celebrate the "birthplace" of American democracy at revolutionary-war sites. These, he said, were America's classic places, "the battlefields, the infant settlements," that became our "matter of history, of poetry, of eloquence." He campaigned in the 1850s for the restoration of Mount Vernon as a shrine, raising $90,000 by delivering his eulogy to Washington before many audiences.<br><br>As a Greek scholar, Everett knew that the state Funeral Oration (Epitaphios Logos, normally shortened to Epitaphios-Epitaphios -- in the plural) was a genre established before Pericles spoke, one whose formulae can be traced in the six surviving examples of the genre? As the earliest known prose performance mandated by the democratic polls, it set the tone and style for most later public rhetoric, By the continuity of its themes and values, it established a sense of Athenian identity. Nicole Loraux, in her influential study of the rite, even claims that Athens was "invented" in this communal act:<br><br>Indeed it may well be that from the end of the fifth century right up to Cleidemus [in the second half of the fourth century] the Athenians were officially content with the "Athenian history of Athens" repeated in every Funeral Oration, in which the series of warlike deeds performed by the <i>polis</i> was interchangeable with a...</p><h2>Kind Is the New Classy: The Power of Living Graciously</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;The world has a way of defining you if you don&#x2019;t know who you are before you get out there.&#x201d; &#x2014;Candace Cameron Bure</strong></p><p>As a woman in today&#x2019;s world, you know what it&#x2019;s like to feel pressure on all sides from clashing cultural expectations.

This fast-paced retelling will captivate readers discovering Homer's epic for the first time.</p></p><p><p>Alan Baker has illustrated The Odyssey and The Story of King Arthur, both published by Kingfisher. In addition, Alan created the popular and successful Little Rabbits series, which has sold over half-a-million copies in the U.S. Alan is a lecturer in illustration at the University of Brighton, England.</p>Grade 4-7 Lister, has, with some success, retold Homer's famed epic for children. Rather than beginning the story in the traditional way, after the battle of Troy, his version begins with the shipwreck on Phaeacia. Odysseus sets the scene with the help of the bard, Demodocus, then tells his story. For a young audience, this flashback technique is confusing and unwieldy. Then, in the next three chapters, Lister crowds all of the historical facts and names that he removed from the beginning. He also tries, mostly in early chapters, to update some of the language while maintaining the tone of the story. The result is uneven and, in some places, humorous; for example, when the Cyclops growls at his uninvited guests, ``Who the hell are you?'' However, Lister's telling improves as the book progresses, and the picture book format with, for the most part, effective, sometimes exciting, full-color illustrations, makes this new version of the Odyssey, while not preferable to those of Picard (Walck, 1952; o.p.), Church (Macmillan, 1951; o.p.), Watson (Golden, 1964; o.p.), and Colum (Macmillan, 1925; o.p.), at least another good choice.

Above all, marriage is a partnership in the service of the Lord. Such a Christward focus causes husbands and wives to soar together for God&#x2019;s glory and for their own enormous satisfaction. <em>Married for God</em> is a profound and practical book, an important read for everyone whose life is blessed to be touched by marriage.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Tim Savage,</strong>&nbsp;Former Senior Pastor, Camelback Bible Church; author, <em>No Ordinary Marriage</em></p><p>&#x201c;Christopher Ash&#x2019;s <em>Married for God</em> commends an inviting, practical, and pastoral vision of biblical marriage.

Beginning with discussions of Trinity, Grace, the Incarnation and Salvation, Himes moves into an exploration of Church as the continuting presence of Jesus Christ in the world today. After discussing what Baptism and the baptismal commitment really involves, he focuses on Eucharist, showing the importance of the sacrament for personal growth and for the building of community. After discussing the Sacraments of Matrimony and Holy Orders, Himes explores the importance of the sacrament of reconciliation in the Christian community, and concludes with a discussion of the great gift to the church that we know as tradition.<br><br> Based on Father Himes' popular video series, <i>The Mystery of Faith</i>, this book includes questions for reflection and discussion at the conclusion of each chapter. An excellent resource for small groups or parish learning communities seeking to revitalize and deepen their understanding of basic Catholic beliefs.<br><br><b>The audio edition of this book can be downloaded via Audible.</b></p><p><b>REV. MICHAEL HIMES</b> holds a doctorate in theology from the University of Chicago. He has taught at the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception (Huntington, New York) and the University of Notre Dame. Currently he is on the faculty of Boston College.Drawn from a video production based on the author's book of the same name, this audio is like an undergraduate course--intellectually rich, dry, and sometimes funny. The author/narrator is a self-contained, experienced cleric who delivers his reflections sometimes as an offering, sometimes as a gentle admonition, and always with the tone of someone with full authority over his teachings. The 10 current issues he covers are the Trinity, grace, incarnation, salvation, church, baptism, the Eucharist, sacraments of vocation, reconciliation, and tradition. Useful to all thinking people, these concise lessons are all satisfying and grounded in the Church's tradition of thinking and reflection.

Hall self-published this massive tome in 1928, consisting of about 200 legal-sized pages in 11 point type; it is literally his magnum opus. Each of the nearly 50 chapters is so dense with information that it is the equivalent of an entire short book. If you read this book in its entirety you will be in a good position to dive into subjects such as the Qabbala, Alchemy, Tarot, Ceremonial Magic, Neo-Platonic Philosophy, Mystery Religions, and the theory of Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry. Although there are some questionable and controversial parts of the book, such as the outdated material on Islam, the portion on the Bacon-Shakespeare hypothesis, and Hall&#39;s conspiracy theory of history as driven by an elite cabal of roving immortals, they are far out-weighed by the comprehensive information here on other subjects.</p><p></p><h2>Fence Vol. 3</h2><p>Scrappy fencer Nicholas Cox comes to the end of his path to prove himself worthy of a father he never knew in the face of surly upperclassmen, nearly impossible odds, and the talent of his rival, sullen fencing prodigy, Seiji Katayama.<br><br>Sparks fly white-hot on the pitch as Nicholas and Seiji finally face off once again in the halls of King&#x2019;s Row.

She lives near Chicago with her husband and daughter.</p>Inspired by the author&#39;s travels to Peru, Ellis&#39;s coming-of-age tale follows the small but significant story of 12-year-old Incan girl named Micay, who is shunned by her community because of &#34;the deep scar that ran like a river from my right eye down my cheek to my lip and lowered my mouth in a permanent half frown.&#34; That changes, however, when a &#34;jungle stranger&#34; comes to town and gives her a scruffy baby macaw named Sumac Huanacauri (&#34;Handsome Rainbow&#34;), who protects her from her tormentor Ucho&#39;s cruelty and teaches her to free herself from doubt, as well as accept that she may be destined for a greater purpose. Micay leaves her &#34;wasi&#34; (one-room home) to explore and study with Paqo, a &#34;mighty shaman&#34; from Cuzco. Micay&#39;s intimate narration weaves in Quechua vocabulary and abundant references to Incan folklore, enhancing the novel&#39;s vivid sense of time and place. Despite the element of shamanism and Micay&#39;s communication with spirits, her transformation is subtle and pragmatic as she evolves from fearful outsider to empowered individual.

Both <i>Uglies</i> and <i>Peeps</i> were named Best Books for Young Adults by the American Library Association in 2006. Read his exclusive Amazon guest review of <i>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i>:</b> <br> <p> </p><p>Teenagers love a good apocalypse. Who doesn't? All those annoying rules suspended. Society's pretenses made irrelevant. Malls to be looted. School out forever.</p> <p>But in <i>The Forest and Hands and Teeth</i>, Carrie Ryan's marvelous debut novel, the post-apocalypse is defined more by constraints than freedoms. The book begins seven generations after the Return, an undead plague that has ended civilization as we know it. Of course, a zombie outbreak usually means shotguns and mall looting--the very essence of freedom. But more than a century on from the Return, the malls have already been looted, and shotguns are a distant memory. The novel's heroine, Mary, lives in a village surrounded by one last vestige of industrial technology: a chain-link fence, beyond which is a vast forest full of shambling, eternally ravenous undead--the forest of hands and teeth. No villager ever goes outside this fence, unless they want to die. (And given this bleak scenario, some do.)</p> <p>Mary's world is bounded not only by the fence but by the archaic traditions of her people, which are enforced by a religious order called the Sisterhood. Marriages, childbirth, death, every stage of life must be controlled to sustain the village's precarious existence. Even the houses are circumscribed--literally--with passages of scripture carved into every entrance to remind the inhabitants of the rules that sustain human life amid the horrors of the forest. </p> <p>After so long an isolation, the village is beginning to forget. Some doubt that there really was a time before the Return, with giant cities and wondrous technologies. Others believe that nothing at all exists beyond the forest of hands and teeth. And nobody but Mary and her slightly mad mother believes in something called "the ocean," a huge and unbounded space beyond the reach of the undead.</p> <p>Mary is the sort of teenager who dreams of bigger things. Not just the ocean, but epic romance and adventure beyond the fence, maybe even other villages somewhere out there, safe behind their own fences. She believes that answers can be found to questions like, What made the Return happen? And what was it like before?</p> <p>Escaping the confines of home for the greater world is, of course, one of the great themes of teen literature. But few heroes in any genre have faced an obstacle as daunting as the forest of hands and teeth. Though Ryan's writing is as lyrical as her title, this novel is driven by the same grim relentlessness that animates any good zombie film. Elegant prose and undead hordes combine to create a story where high drama feels completely unforced, where tension is constant, and where an image as simple as the open sea is achingly romantic.</p> <p>Zombies have been metaphors for many things: consumerism, contagion in an overpopulated world, the inevitability of death. But here they resonate with a particularly teenage realization about the world--that social limits and backward traditions are numberless and unstoppable, no matter how shambling they may seem at first.</p> <p>And yet we must try to escape them anyway, lest we wither inside the fence.<i>--Scott Westerfeld</i> </p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: A Q&amp;A with Carrie Ryan</strong> <p></p> We had the opportunity to chat with Carrie Ryan over e-mail about her first novel, <i>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i>. Here&#x2019;s what Carrie had to say about George Romero, the growing popularity of young adult fiction, and how she's preparing for the zombie apocalypse. <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> You have said you began your writing career intending to write &#x201c;chick lit.&#x201d; How, then, did you come to write <i>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i>, which, on first glance, is a far cry from that genre? </p> <p><b>Carrie Ryan:</b> In college many of the short stories I wrote were fairly dark but I&#x2019;d always heard the advice that you should write what you read and at the time I loved to read romantic comedies and chick lit. So when I decided to attempt a novel, that&#x2019;s what I tried to write even though it didn&#x2019;t fit my natural tone. In fact, when I first tried to write a romantic comedy I had to constantly pull myself away from writing dark (and the reason I never tried to sell that book is because too many characters die which wasn&#x2019;t very comedic!). Even the young adult chick lit I was working on tended to be dark--the main character interned at a coroners office and was surrounded by death.</p> <p>So writing <i>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i> was more of me embracing my true voice. I think I&#x2019;d been scared to just indulge in it before, afraid that there wouldn&#x2019;t be a market for it (and in fact, even when I was writing <i>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i> I was convinced it wasn&#x2019;t saleable). As soon as I jotted down the first line I decided to write it the way I wanted--to experiment and push the bounds and not worry about the market or what other people would think. This was the story I realized I had to tell when my fianc� suggested, &#x201c;write what you love.&#x201d;</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Your book has drawn inevitable comparison to the archetypal zombie flick, <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>. How does Mary&#x2019;s world differ from the world George Romero created more than 40 years ago? Are the movies what first got you hooked on zombies?</p> <p> <b>Ryan:</b> George Romero has really sparked a lot of imaginations and while any book or movie with zombies inevitably owes a massive debt to Romero's world, I tend not to think of <i>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i> as a "zombie book," but rather a book that happens to have zombies in it. <i>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i>, which takes place generations after the apocalypse, is really about a girl struggling with growing up, desire, and a controlling society set against the backdrop of a world with zombies (called &#x201c;Unconsecrated&#x201d;) constantly pushing against the fences. The characters have already come to terms with the Return (the zombie apocalypse) and know nothing else: this is their world and they've accepted it.</p> <p>Romero's movies, on the other hand, deal more directly with the zombies--the plot arc of <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> is having to reckon with and defend against a zombie apocalypse as it occurs. In Romero's world the characters are still trying to fight against the zombies, still trying to reclaim the world of "before." In my book, the "before" time is lost, beyond memory, and the Unconsecrated are not so much the focal point as a part of the setting.</p> <p>I do think watching the remake of <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> sparked my interest in zombies and led to my watching other zombie movies, including Romero's. One of the things I love the best about his movies, and something that inspired me, is that while they may appear to be simply zombie flicks on the surface, they're actually a commentary on society and are often a reflection of societal fears.</p> <p>Like many other authors and directors, I wanted to use zombies as a mirror for the characters in my book. In the end, though, what influenced me most was the idea of a girl growing up trapped in a village that has forgotten everything and her hope that there could be something more beyond the menace in the Forest surrounding them, and that's what <i>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i> is really about.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Many young adult books with post-apocalyptic settings have been gaining a wide adult fan base--Suzanne Collins&#x2019;s <i>The Hunger Games</i> and Susan Beth Pfeffer&#x2019;s <i>Life As We Knew It</i> are a couple of examples. Why do you think these books are attracting a wider audience?</p> <p><b>Ryan:</b> It&#x2019;s been really exciting to see so many young adult books find such popularity with adult readers and I&#x2019;ve loved re-introducing both my mom and sister to the young adult section. In the past I think readers have &#x201c;graduated&#x201d; to adult books and there&#x2019;s been this feeling that young adult books are &#x201c;just for teens&#x201d; and are therefore somehow lighter and less substantive. While there have always been phenomenal young adult books published every year, it&#x2019;s really felt like there&#x2019;s been a renaissance recently: more books that are pushing the boundaries in every way. </p> <p>Not only are a lot of sophisticated young adult books being published, but they&#x2019;re accessible to everyone--most adults can remember those years of their life and tap into those emotions and feelings. But even more, so many of these books also tap into adult emotions and feelings: how to survive, figuring out what matters in life, struggling with changing relationships. These books make us question our decisions and ourselves and, especially in the current atmosphere of apprehension in the world, people are looking inward to what really matters to them.</p> <p>Ultimately, I like to think that the bottom line is there are just really really great books in the young adult section and that great books will find a wide audience, no matter where they&#x2019;re placed.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> <i>In The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i>, no one seems to know how the Unconsecrated (the zombies that live outside the village gates) first came into existence. What do you suspect would trigger the zombie apocalypse?</p> <p><b>Ryan:</b> This is actually one of my favorite parts of any zombie book or movie: seeing how the apocalypse is triggered. There are so many different ways it can happen (and has happened)! Aliens, s�ances, military and medical experiments gone wrong, parasites, environmental mishaps. You name it, it&#x2019;s caused the zombie apocalypse (I&#x2019;m still waiting for a movie with chocolate overindulgence as the trigger!)</p> <p>But I actually made a conscious decision to leave the cause of the Return a mystery in <i>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i>. One reason is that I wanted to show how knowledge and history could erode so drastically over time. The characters in my book have been so isolated and controlled that they think the ocean is a myth; they have no conception of the world before the Return.</p> <p>Ultimately, I recognized that the cause of the Return doesn&#x2019;t matter to the characters or the story. There are so many books and movies that focus on why and how such an apocalypse occurs but my book takes place so long after the event that it&#x2019;s meaningless. I really wanted to draw that distinction between my world and other zombie worlds: that it doesn&#x2019;t matter how or why or what triggered the zombie apocalypse, just that it happened and that&#x2019;s the world they live in now.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> So, how are you preparing for the zombie apocalypse?</p> <p><b>Ryan:</b> We&#x2019;re not at all prepared! It&#x2019;s funny, shortly after seeing my first zombie movie I dreamt there was a zombie apocalypse and how I would handle it if stuck in the apartment I was living in at the time. Even after waking up I kept trying to figure out how I would survive (how to defend myself, get water, find help, etc.). I&#x2019;ve since thought through similar issues with every place we&#x2019;ve lived sort of as a fun thought experiment and I&#x2019;ve come to the conclusion that we were much safer when we lived in a top floor apartment than our one-story house with too many windows!</p> <p>To prepare, I just continue to read books, watch movies and am currently trying to train my puppy to be a zombie-sniffing dog.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CARRIE RYAN is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of The Forest of Hands and Teeth trilogy that includes The Forest of Hands and Teeth, The Dead-Tossed Waves, The Dark and Hollow Places, and the original ebook Hare Moon.

He is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author of the Half Upon a Time, Story Thieves, and Revenge of Magic series.Twice Upon a Time CHAPTER 1<p></p> <br>Once upon a time, Jack knew better than to do certain things. You didn&#x2019;t waste time trying to find the perfect temperature of porridge in a bear&#x2019;s house. You didn&#x2019;t point out to your suddenly extremely furry grandmother how big her fangs were. And you definitely didn&#x2019;t walk through a creepy fog while music from magical pipes drifted in eerily. These weren&#x2019;t even questions, you just didn&#x2019;t do them&#x2014;not if you wanted to stay uneaten by three bears, disguised wolves, or scary old musicians.<br> <br>Except here he was&#x2014;fog, magical pipe music and all, and he just wanted to find the stupid Piper and get on with things.<br> <br>Unfortunately, not everyone was so goal oriented.<br> <br>&#x201c;Does anyone else want to follow him?&#x201d; May asked, shivering in her oversize blue cloak as her head bobbed to the music. She shifted a backpack full of food&#x2014;a gift from Phillip&#x2019;s mother&#x2014;higher on her shoulder as she moved with the melody.<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope you are joking, Princess,&#x201d; Phillip said, shooting her a worried glance. &#x201c;Remember, we are not to go into his cave. That is where the children from the village went, and they never returned.&#x201d;<br> <br>As if to reinforce the creepiness, a blackbird crowed loudly, then took to the air from some tree hidden in the fog. Jack shivered, thinking the bird almost sounded like it was calling his name.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, I know, no cave,&#x201d; May said, rolling her eyes before swaying to the music again.<br> <br>Jack sighed and stopped her. &#x201c;Maybe you should wait a little distance away.... You don&#x2019;t seem to be handling this all that well.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The rhythm isn&#x2019;t going to get me,&#x201d; May said absently. &#x201c;Besides, what&#x2019;s the worst it could do? Tell me my grandmother is a horrible tyrant who tried to take over half the world? &#x2019;Cause, too late.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack and Phillip glanced at each other, and Jack could see his own concern reflected in the prince&#x2019;s eyes. May caught their look, and shoved them apart. &#x201c;What did I say about doing that!&#x201d; she shouted a bit too loudly for Jack&#x2019;s taste. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine! It&#x2019;s been three months. I&#x2019;m over it!&#x201d; She glared at Jack. &#x201c;Either that or I&#x2019;m quietly going crazy and I&#x2019;ll hand you both over to the next giant we come across. Care to bet on which way it&#x2019;s gonna go if you keep giving Phillip those stupid emo worry looks?!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Seems like crazy&#x2019;s taking the early lead,&#x201d; Jack said, then quickly turned and continued on ahead, trying to ignore the glare she had just thrown at him.<br> <br>&#x201c;If this is too much for you, we could find another way&#x2014;,&#x201d; Phillip began, but May shushed him.<br> <br>&#x201c;It took us this long just to find the Piper,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I want to know who I am already! And besides, I for one am tired of rescuing you from various invisible gnomes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Phillip smiled. &#x201c;I thought you said that we would never speak of that again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yet someone keeps bringing it up,&#x201d; May said, her face expressionless.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can we concentrate?&#x201d; Jack said, dragging May forward and away from Phillip. &#x201c;The sooner we pay the Piper, the sooner we get to the Fairy Homelands and find Merriweather, so that&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So that we can find out for sure that I&#x2019;m completely alone,&#x201d; May said.<br> <br>Jack sighed. &#x201c;I was going to say &#x2018;so that we can find your family... and I can finally go home.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> <br>Phillip grabbed Jack by the shoulders and shook him gently. &#x201c;Go home? Why would you ever want that? Look at where you are! We stand in the middle of a dark, fog-drenched field. Off in the distance a figure waits, known only to us in tales told to frighten children. Enemy or ally, we will not know until it is too late, yet press on we must!&#x201d; The prince shook with excitement at the idea, while Jack just sighed and waited for him to finish. &#x201c;What is the point of life without adventures like this?!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;See, I like to think the point of life is to be happy,&#x201d; Jack said with a shrug. &#x201c;Also maybe not almost dying every two minutes. But I can see how we&#x2019;ll have to agree to disagree here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe we can agree to go talk to the man?&#x201d; May said, and pushed on ahead of the two boys. As she approached the figure in the distance, the music began to slow, eventually coming to a halt just as they were finally able to make out a thin, stooped figure leaning against a gnarled, blackened tree stump. The man wore a tunic of dull red, belted by a green rope with several heavy-looking pouches hanging from it. And though the music had stopped, the pipes remained at the old man&#x2019;s lips, his eyes closed as if he were still playing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good evening, sir,&#x201d; Phillip said.<br> <br>The man didn&#x2019;t move.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, we heard you could maybe help us,&#x201d; May said.<br> <br>The man didn&#x2019;t move.<br> <br>&#x201c;See, typically this would be the moment most people respond,&#x201d; Jack said. Nothing. &#x201c;This is creepy,&#x201d; he whispered to May and Phillip. &#x201c;Maybe he wants his payment&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Payment?&#x201d; the old man said, lowering his pipes and opening his eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think he heard you,&#x201d; May whispered to Jack.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so glad you&#x2019;re here to point these things out,&#x201d; Jack whispered back.<br> <br>The old man sighed. &#x201c;Ah. You three. It&#x2019;s about time.&#x201d;<br> <br>May cleared her throat. &#x201c;You were... waiting for us?&#x201d;<br> <br>The old man snorted. &#x201c;For longer than I&#x2019;d care to admit. You think I have nothing better to do than leave my cave in one place while I sit here, playing my pipes? The longer my cave and I stay here, the more likely it is that the Queen will find me.&#x201d; He glared at May. &#x201c;Thanks to you three, she probably will. And now you want my help.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack winced, trying not to make the mention of her grandmother a bigger deal by looking at May. Thankfully, Phillip stepped forward, taking a large bag from Jack&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;We seek passage to the Fairy Homelands, sir,&#x201d; the prince said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course you do,&#x201d; the Piper said, eyeing the bag. &#x201c;And I see you&#x2019;ve brought payment?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sounds like you&#x2019;re not a man to let bills go unpaid,&#x201d; Jack said quietly, his eyes on the pipes.<br> <br>The Piper smiled. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;m owed something, then I will collect. The Piper will be paid, children, one way or another.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, we visited the last town who didn&#x2019;t pay,&#x201d; May said. &#x201c;The youngest person there was like sixty.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They promised payment if I removed their rats,&#x201d; the Piper said, absently sticking his pinkie into one of the pipes as if he were cleaning it out. &#x201c;I delivered, yet they did not. So I took... another form of payment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Their children,&#x201d; Jack said, shivering from more than the fog&#x2019;s chill.<br> <br>&#x201c;None were harmed,&#x201d; the Piper said, standing up to grab the bag almost indignantly from Phillip. He looked inside, and his face lit up, a smile harmonizing with the sparkle in his eyes. &#x201c;Yes, yes, whispering reeds from the Swamp of All&#x2019;s End! Which of you harvested...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I did,&#x201d; Jack said, glaring at the bag. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ve still got the burns. No one ever told us they whisper fire.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They will do nicely,&#x201d; the Piper said, ignoring him. &#x201c;Now you&#x2019;ve paid, and royally so. Speak your wish, and I will do what I can.&#x201d;<br> <br>May stepped forward, a bit nervously. &#x201c;We, uh, wish to travel to the Fairy Homelands. Please. Thank you. Please.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Piper looked at her for a moment, then, almost faster than Jack could see, he raised his pipes to his lips, blew one note, and lowered the pipes. Like magic (appropriately enough), May instantly relaxed at the sound, letting out a huge breath she&#x2019;d apparently been holding in.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s better,&#x201d; the Piper said. &#x201c;You have nothing to fear, children. Not from me, not anymore.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I would if I were afraid of cryptic statements,&#x201d; Jack murmured. The Piper glared at him, and began to raise his pipes to his lips again, so Jack quickly added, &#x201c;But of course I&#x2019;m not, who would be, and we have nothing but the utmost respect for you. Sir. Your Highness.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Fairy Homelands,&#x201d; the Piper said. &#x201c;Not the easiest destination.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack snorted. &#x201c;Not exactly, no. We&#x2019;ve been searching for a way to them for the past three months. And from what we&#x2019;ve found, there is no natural way to get there. We need magic. And a very specific kind of magic.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Piper smiled, then held up his pipes. &#x201c;Music,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s true. The fairies don&#x2019;t think in words or pictures like you and I do. They think and talk in music... so that&#x2019;s how they perform their magic as well. That&#x2019;s why most humans can&#x2019;t understand the little ones, though the fairy queens are able to speak our language easily enough.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack glanced over at the golden fairy in May&#x2019;s hair, and the fairy winked at him. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s right, stupid human,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;If your kind were smart enough to understand music, you might have fewer problems.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We might have had fewer problems if you&#x2019;d known where the Fairy Homelands were!&#x201d; Jack whispered back at her.<br> <br>&#x201c;NO fairy knows!&#x201d; the golden fairy shouted. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re sent away at birth! But if we live by the code and spread more good than ill, we might eventually be allowed back in! YOU are the ones trying to take shortcuts!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So that humming is her talking?&#x201d; May said, then turned to Jack. &#x201c;And would you stop yelling at her? It&#x2019;s not like she can understand you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, stupid human. It&#x2019;s not like I can understand you!&#x201d; the golden fairy shouted, sticking out her tongue.<br> <br>&#x201c;I hate you,&#x201d; Jack said to her, turning away. &#x201c;So, so, so much.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Regardless,&#x201d; the Piper said. &#x201c;My music can take you to the Fairy Homelands.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And bring us back, right?&#x201d; Jack added quickly.<br> <br>The Piper&#x2019;s eyes twinkled. &#x201c;If you wish. For that you&#x2019;ll need something more.&#x201d; The Piper reached into a pocket and produced a wooden whistle, which he handed to Phillip.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice catch,&#x201d; May whispered to Jack.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure the fairy queens are nice and all, but I&#x2019;m not spending the rest of my life stuck in a whole city of these things,&#x201d; Jack whispered back, glaring at the golden fairy, who made a face at him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Blow into this whistle when you are finished,&#x201d; the Piper continued, &#x201c;and you&#x2019;ll return right to this spot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Return to this spot?&#x201d; Jack asked. &#x201c;Are we leaving soon&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>The Piper brought his pipes to his lips and blew a melody so quick and intricate that it sounded like three or four Pipers playing all at once. The mist began swirling around faster and faster as the music sped up, creating a whirlwind of fog that quickly obscured the Piper, the cave, and everything else from view. The music grew louder, filling Jack&#x2019;s head, obliterating his thoughts, taking over his mind, not letting him even think&#x2014;<br> <br>Only to stop abruptly, dropping them onto grass much brighter than it had any right to be, on ground that was both softer and harder than any Jack had ever felt. He groaned, then pushed himself up, noticing a glowing paved stone roadway beginning just a few feet away from the spot where he&#x2019;d landed. Whereas behind him...<br> <br>Behind him was only mist.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think we&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; May said, matching his groan a little just to Jack&#x2019;s right.<br> <br>&#x201c;There does seem to be something... different about this place,&#x201d; Phillip said, then gasped.<br> <br>Jack quickly followed Phillip&#x2019;s gaze, up the paved road to a gate that seemed to be made of silver latticework circles, then past that to...<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh-oh,&#x201d; Jack said.<br> <br>&#x201c;No uh-ohs!&#x201d; May said, glaring at him. &#x201c;NO! Not after everything we&#x2019;ve been through! No more uh-ohs!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I do not think we have a choice, Princess,&#x201d; Phillip said.<br> <br>May started to reply, then finally saw what the other two were staring at. &#x201c;Uh-oh,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>On the other side of the gate, enormous tree-trunk-size vines blocked out all view of what lay beyond as the vines circled and intertwined with one another. Between that and the fist-size thorns growing out of them every foot or so, the overall effect was definitely &#x201c;Uh-oh.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; Phillip said, his voice choking a bit as he pointed. Just past the gate something lay crumpled over one of the vines. Jack stepped closer, and realized with a start that it wasn&#x2019;t something so much as someone.<br> <br>&#x201c;NO!&#x201d; the golden fairy yelled. &#x201c;My queen!&#x201d; She leapt into the air and quickly flew at the tangle of vines, reaching out desperately for what appeared to be the body of a fairy queen.<br> <br>Jack immediately launched himself out to grab her, knowing that it was too late but not being willing to just let the fairy fly headfirst into whatever curse had turned the Fairy Homelands into this overgrown... whatever it was.<br> <br>Unfortunately, Jack was right. He was too late.<br> <br>The golden fairy passed the silver gate and immediately dropped to the ground, landing hard on a vine, her body unmoving.<br> <br>And a second later, unable to stop, Jack&#x2019;s momentum sent him tumbling past the gate as well, and into oblivion.</p><h2>The Thirst: A Harry Hole Novel (11) (Harry Hole Series)</h2><p><b>#1 International Best Seller&nbsp;<br><br> In this electrifying thriller from the author of<i>&nbsp;Police</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Snowman</i>, Inspector Harry Hole hunts down a serial murderer who targets his victims . . . on Tinder.<br> &nbsp;<br> </b>The murder victim, a self-declared Tinder addict.

Apart from each time the door opened and enough steam was sucked out for him to be able to glimpse a naked man for a brief moment before the door closed and everything was shrouded in fog.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The baths would be closing soon. He was alone.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> He wrapped the white towelling bathrobe more tightly around him, got up from the wooden bench and walked out, past the empty swimming pool and into the changing room.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> No trickling showers, no conversations in Turkish, no bare feet padding across the tiled floor. He looked at himself in the mirror. Ran a finger along the scar that was still visible after the last operation. It had taken him time to get used to his new face. His finger carried on down his throat, across his chest, and came to a halt at the start of the tattoo.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> He removed the padlock from his locker, pulled on his trousers and put his coat on over the still damp bathrobe. Tied his shoelaces. He made sure he was definitely alone before going over to a locker with a coded padlock, one with a splash of blue paint on it. He turned the lock until it read 0999. Removed the lock and opened the door. Took a moment to admire the big, beautiful revolver that lay inside before taking hold of the red hilt and putting it in his coat pocket. Then he removed the envelope and opened it. A key. An address, and some more detailed information.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> There was one more thing in the locker.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Painted black, made of iron.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> He held it up against the light with&nbsp;one hand, looking at the wrought ironwork with fascination.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> He would have to clean it, scrub it, but he already felt aroused at the thought of using it.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Three years. Three years in a white nothingness, in a desert of empty days.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Now it was time. Time he drank from the well of life again.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Time he returned.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Harry woke with a start. Stared out at the semi-darkness of the bedroom. It was <i>him </i>again, he was back, he was here.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nightmare, darling?&#x201d; The whispered voice by his side was warm and soothing.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> He turned towards her. Her brown eyes studied his. And the apparition faded and disappeared.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; Rakel said.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And here I am,&#x201d; he said.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who was it this time?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No one,&#x201d; he lied, and touched her cheek. &#x201c;Go back to sleep.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Harry closed his eyes. Waited until he was sure she had closed hers before opening his again. He studied her face. He had seen him in a forest this time. Moorland, wreathed in white fog that swirled around them. He had raised his hand and pointed something towards Harry. He could just make out the demonic, tattooed face on his naked chest. Then the fog had grown thicker, and he was gone. Gone again.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And here I am,&#x201d; Harry Hole whispered.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter One</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Elise walked down Thorvald Meyers gate, past plain four-storey buildings that had once housed the working classes in a poor part of a poor city, but where one square metre now cost as much as in London or Stockholm. September in Oslo. The darkness was back at last, and the drawn-out, annoyingly light summer nights were long gone, with all the hysterical, cheerful, stupid self-expression of summer. In September Oslo reverted to its true self: melancholic, reserved, efficient. A solid facade, but not without its dark corners and secrets. Much like her, apparently. She quickened her pace; there was rain in the air, mist, the spray when God sneezed, as one of her dates had put it in an attempt to be poetic. She was going to give up Tinder. Tomorrow. Enough was enough. Enough randy men whose way of looking at her made her feel like a whore when she met them in bars. Enough crazy psychopaths and stalkers who stuck like mud, sucking time, energy and security from her. Enough pathetic losers who made her feel like she was one of them.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> They said Internet dating was the cool way to meet new people, that it was nothing to be ashamed of anymore, that everyone was doing it. But that wasn&#x2019;t true. People met each other at work, in classrooms, through friends, at the gym, in cafes, on planes, buses, trains. They met each other the way they were supposed to meet each other, when they were relaxed, no pressure, and afterwards they could cling to the romantic illusion of innocence, purity and quirks of fate. She <i>wanted </i>that illusion. She was going to delete her profile. She&#x2019;d told herself that before, but this time it was definitely going to happen, that very night.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She crossed Sofienberggata and fished out the key to unlock the gate next to the greengrocer&#x2019;s. She pushed the gate open and stepped into the darkness of the archway. And stopped dead.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> There were two of them.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It took a moment or two for her eyes to get used to the darkness, and for her to see what they were holding in their hands. Both men had undone their trousers and had their cocks out.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She jerked back. Didn&#x2019;t look round, just prayed that there was no one standing behind her.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Fucksorry.&#x201d; The combination of oath and apology was uttered by a young voice. Nineteen, twenty, Elise guessed. Not sober.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Duh,&#x201d; the other one said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re pissing all over my shoes!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I was startled!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Elise pulled her coat more tightly around her and walked past the young men, who had turned back to face the wall again. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t a public toilet,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sorry, we were desperate. It won&#x2019;t happen again.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> ...<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ping.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> A match on Tinder.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The triumphant sound your phone makes when someone you&#x2019;ve already swiped right on swipes <i>your </i>picture right as well.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Elise&#x2019;s head was spinning, her heart was racing.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She knew it was the familiar response to the sound of Tinder&#x2019;s matchmaking: increased heart rate as a consequence of excitement. That it released a whole load of happy chemicals that you could become addicted to. But that wasn&#x2019;t why her heart was galloping. It was because the ping hadn&#x2019;t come from <i>her </i>phone.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> But the ping had rung out at the very moment she&#x2019;d swiped right on a picture. The picture of a person who, according to Tinder, was less than a kilometre away from her.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She stared at the closed bedroom door. Swallowed.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The sound must have come from one of the neighbouring apartments. There were lots of single people living in the block, lots of potential Tinder users. And everything was quiet now, even on the floor below where the girls had been having a party when she went out earlier that evening. But there was only one way to get rid of imaginary monsters. By checking.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Elise got up from the sofa and walked the four steps over to the bedroom door. Hesitated. A couple of assault cases from work swirled through her head.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Then she pulled herself together and opened the door.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She found herself standing in the doorway gasping for air. Because there wasn&#x2019;t any. None that she could breathe.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The light above the bed was switched on, and the first thing she saw was the soles of a pair of cowboy boots sticking off the end of the bed. Jeans and a pair of long legs, crossed. The man lying there was like the photograph, half in darkness, half out of focus. But he had unbuttoned his shirt to reveal his bare chest. And on his chest was a drawing or a tattoo of a face. That was what caught her eye now. The silently screaming face. As if it were held tight and was trying to pull free. Elise couldn&#x2019;t bring herself to scream either.</p><h2>Sense &amp; Sensibility: A BabyLit� Opposites Primer (BabyLit Primers)</h2><p><p>Observe the life and loves of the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, in Sense &amp; Sensibility: A BabyLit Opposites Primer.

The simple texts with repetitive phrases and picture clues are perfect for the youngest readers. Lascaro's colored-pencil and paper-collage illustrations in Down on the Farm are bright, bold, and thoughtfully placed on each double-page spread. An animal is shown on the left side of the page while a young girl imitates its action on the right side ("I see my duck swim. I can swim like my duck"). With a slightly longer rhyming text and the artist's familiar pen-and-ink and watercolor illustrations, McPhail's humorous book is also right on target. Big Bear is brown but soon changes color as Little Bear accidentally knocks into his ladder while he is painting a tree house blue. After cleaning up, Big Bear returns with green paint and readers are left with a giggle as the next impending disaster is suggested. In both books, the illustrations fill the pages while the text is plain and clearly set in an appropriately large font on a white background.

Sherman, Pocatello Public Library, ID</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Thinking and Reasoning: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)</h2><p>Our extraordinary capacity to reason and solve problems sets us aside from other animals, but our evolved thinking processes also leave us susceptible to bias and error. The study of thinking and reasoning goes back to Aristotle, and was one of the first topics to be studied when psychology separated from philosophy. <br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> Jonathan Evans explores cognitive psychological approaches to understanding the nature of thinking and reasoning, problem solving, and decision making. He shows how our problem solving capabilities are hugely dependent on also having the imagination to ask the right questions, and the ability to see things from a completely new perspective. Beginning by considering the approaches of the behaviorists and the Gestalt psychologists, he moves on to modern explorations of thinking, including hypothetical thinking, conditionals, deduction, rationality, and intuition. Covering the role of past learning, IQ, and cognitive biases, Evans also discusses the idea that there may be two different ways of thinking, arising from our evolutionary history. <br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES: </strong>The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jonathan Evans</strong> is Emeritus Professor at the School of Psychology, Plymouth University, where he was previously Professor of Cognitive Psychology. He has spent his entire career in the study of thinking and reasoning, and was involved in setting up the journal, <em>Thinking and Reasoning </em>(published by Taylor and Francis). He has authored a number of books, including <em>Hypothetical Thinking</em> (Psychology Press, 2007) and <em>Thinking Twice</em> (OUP, 2010), and two with the philosopher David Over, presenting a new theory of conditionals (<em>Rationality and Reasoning</em>, Psychology Press, 1996; <em>If</em>, OUP, 2004).<br><br>"Highly readable and thought provoking." - <em>Nursing Times</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Willa of the Wood (Willa of the Wood, Book 1) (Willa of the Wood, 1)</h2><p><b>Handpicked by Amazon kids&#x2019; books editor, Seira Wilson, for Prime Book Box &#x2013; a children&#x2019;s subscription that inspires a love of reading.</b><br><br><b>From Robert Beatty, the author of the award-winning&nbsp;Serafina books, comes a thrilling new #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series for adults and young readers (8+).

It would go on to be translated, photocopied, and handed from one activist to another, traveling from country to country across the globe: from Iran to Venezuela where <i>both</i> countries consider Gene Sharp to be an enemy of the state to Serbia; Afghanistan; Vietnam; the former Soviet Union; China; Nepal; and, more recently and notably, Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, Libya, and Syria, where it has served as a guiding light of the Arab Spring.<br><br>This short, pithy, inspiring, and extraordinarily clear guide to overthrowing a dictatorship by nonviolent means lists 198 specific methods to consider, depending on the circumstances: sit-ins, popular nonobedience, selective strikes, withdrawal of bank deposits, revenue refusal, walkouts, silence, and hunger strikes. <i>From Dictatorship to Democracy</i> is the remarkable work that has made the little-known Sharp into the world&#x2019;s most effective and sought-after analyst of resistance to authoritarian regimes.<br><br></p><p><p>Gene Sharp advised governments and resistance movements around the world and was considered the most influential living promoter of nonviolent resistance to autocratic governments. He was a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, and the founder of the Albert Einstein Institution, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the study of nonviolent action.

Pierre&#x2019;s faith-centered understanding of people combines with a Word-centered methodology to give readers a practical way to help others better understand their tough experiences and who they are in light of who Jesus is. Pierre guides readers through four key activities&#x2014;reading, reflecting, relating, and renewing&#x2014;that will consistently position them to understand everyday human experiences in light of Scripture.</p> <p>Pierre exposes the false dichotomy between the spiritual and seemingly unspiritual parts of the human experience, showing how every thought, feeling, and choice actually expresses the spiritual activity of the heart. He shows how faith in Christ is the means by which the heart begins to respond differently. Faith is not only the entry point for heart change, but also an expression of our everyday, ongoing need for Christ. </p> <p>Pierre&#x2019;s holistic view of counseling&#x2014;forged by his experiences as a counselor, pastor, and seminary professor&#x2014;equips readers to understand how everyday beliefs, desires, and commitments shape how we respond to life&#x2019;s biggest struggles and how an active relationship of trust in God is the foundation for lifelong change.</p></p><p><p><b>Jeremy Pierre, PhD</b>, is Associate Professor of Biblical Counseling and Dean of Students at Southern Seminary.

He and his wife Sarah raise their five children in Louisville, Kentucky.</p>&#x201c;Scripture commands us to pay careful attention not only to our actions but also to our hearts. Yet, as many Christians know, the fight against indwelling sin can be one of the most challenging and exhausting aspects of the Christian life. In this book, Jeremy Pierre shows us how to deal with our hearts according to the truths of the Gospel. This book, firmly committed to the sufficiency and authority of Scripture, is a needed resource for the church.&#x201d;<br>R. Albert Mohler, Jr., President of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;In The Dynamic Heart in Daily Life, Jeremy Pierre wonderfully describes how a heart with dynamic faith will so value things that God finds valuable that God becomes the &#x2018;control desire&#x2019; in human experience, emotion, and choice. This insight provides not simply an understanding of human motivation but a profoundly helpful tool for transformative Christian counseling.&#x201d;<br>Bryan Chapell, Pastor, Grace Presbyterian Church; author, Holiness by Grace and Christ-Centered Preaching<br><br>&#x201c;I am delighted to see this book in print. Jeremy Pierre has ministered to me as a friend and colleague much more than he realizes. Now, through this book, many others can see why he is so appreciated by his students, seminary associates, and fellow church members. In these pages pastors, counselors, caretakers, and just about anyone who works with people will find help to better understand the heart and experience of the person in front of them, and thereby be more fully equipped to minister Christ to that person.&#x201d;<br>Donald S. Whitney, Professor of Biblical Spirituality, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary; author of Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life and Praying the Bible<br><br>&#x201c;There is nothing more important in counseling and Christian growth than understanding what God&#x2019;s Word says about the heart. That is why I am excited and thankful for Jeremy Pierre&#x2019;s new book. He thoroughly unpacks what Scripture says about the heart and then brings to light how we can practically fulfill this instruction in our counseling and in our everyday life. I highly recommend it and look forward to using this volume in many aspects of local church ministry.&#x201d;<br>Steve Viars, Senior Pastor, Faith Church, Lafayette, Indiana<br><br>&#x201c;Thoughts. Emotions. Choices. All three are important aspects of human experience. Overlook one or more aspects, and ministry to struggling people will be truncated at its best and dangerous at its worst. In this well-organized resource, Jeremy Pierre paints a three-dimensional picture of our hearts in relation to God, self, others, and the circumstances of life. In so doing he gives pastors, counselors, and other leaders a helpful, Christ-centered framework for wise and balanced ministry.&#x201d;<br>Michael R. Emlet, Faculty and Counselor, Christian Counseling and Educational Foundation (CCEF); author of CrossTalk: Where Life and Scripture Meet<br><br>&#x201c;Christians are privileged today to have access to many books that are true and helpful. But every now and then a book comes along that is truly brilliant. The Dynamic Heart is such a book. Dr. Pierre expertly weds a theology of the soul and an explanation of the practice of personal care to create one of the most important books ever written in the biblical counseling movement. Every student and practitioner of counseling needs to become familiar with the concepts in this book.&#x201d;<br>Heath Lambert, Associate Pastor, First Baptist Church Jacksonville, Florida; Executive Director, Association of Certified Biblical Counselors <br><br>&#x201c;In this illuminating work, Pierre shines a light on our hearts so that we have a more profound understanding of both others and ourselves. Still, this book is not fundamentally about human beings but about human beings in relationship with God. As a master teacher, Pierre helps us think through what it means practically for God to be the Lord of our hearts and the Lord of our lives. What a delight to read a book that is written so clearly, and the illustrations and anecdotes bring home wonderfully the message of the book. At the same time, Pierre is faithful biblically and theologically. Counselors, pastors, and, yes, all Christians will want to read this book.&#x201d;<br>Thomas R. Schreiner, James Buchanan Harrison Professor of New Testament Interpretation and Associate Dean, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville, Kentucky<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Jeremy Pierre&#x2019;s masterful piece, The Dynamic Heart in Daily Life, offers a theologically robust, intellectually rich, and conceptually accessible model of human psychology that is thoroughly biblical in nature. This book offers both counselor and counselee a comprehensive assessment of the inner dynamics at play upon the human experience while providing, thoughtful, practical wisdom in applying scriptural truth to that aspect of our humanity known most deeply by God alone&#x2014;the heart. A genuinely enlightening read.&#x201d;<br>Jeremy Lelek, President, Association of Biblical Counselors&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Dysfunction occurs when a heart&#x2019;s worship design is directed away from God and toward self,&#x201d; says Pierre. This book is packed with biblical wisdom, keen observations, pastoral sensitivity and understanding, and practical applications into very complex issues in order to help the counselor and counselee move from the fallen dynamics of the heart to the joyful experience of the redeemed soul. Definitely, it is the best I have seen in this field.&#x201d;<br>Miguel N��ez, Senior Pastor International Baptist Church of Santo Domingo; President, Wisdom &amp; Integrity Ministries<br><br>What a load of wisdom&#x2014;biblical, theological, psychological, and relational&#x2014;is contained within this book! It may be the most comprehensive treatment of the human heart written by a Christian counselor in our day. Evident throughout is the guidance of a thoughtful, godly, caring, and open-hearted Christian, guided himself by deep biblical convictions. It will be widely recognized as an outstanding contribution to biblical counseling literature.<br>Eric L. Johnson, Lawrence and Charlotte Hoover Professor of Pastoral Care, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br>&#x201c;If we understand other people accurately we will be nearly over-whelmed by the complexity of their lives&#x2014;Dr. Pierre wants us to get close to the brink as a way to walk humbly with those we help. But then, like an experienced pastor-teacher, he takes us into sound doc-trine and actually equips us to know and help with wisdom and love.&#x201d;<br>Edward T. Welch, CCEF faculty; psychologist; best-selling author <br><br>&#x201c;Jeremy Pierre understands that in order to shepherd the flock, the pastor must also be a doctor of souls. In this book he provides bibli�cal knowledge, shows how to make a proper diagnosis, and sharpens our skills in prescribing the remedy Scripture provides. It is a must-read for all involved in pastoral care. I recommend it with unreserved enthusiasm.&#x201d;<br>Alistair Begg, Senior Minister, Parkside Church, Chagrin Falls, Ohio <br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve all had this thought many times, no doubt: How profoundly helpful it would be to understand better why people (including you) do, and say, and act, and feel, the way we do. Even better, how liberating it would be to see what can be done to help people (including you) change and grow in human wholeness and Christlikeness. Jeremy Pierre&#x2019;s The Dynamic Heart in Daily Life provides such perspective, and I can guarantee every reader that they will benefit greatly in self-understanding from reading this profound, biblical, sane, and insightful book. One will find here a theology of the heart, a theology of human experience, and a theology of counseling that is revolutionary. For your own heart&#x2019;s sake, and for the benefit of others you have the privilege to help in their growth, I strongly encourage a careful reading of this excellent primer on the human heart.&#x201d;<br>Bruce A. Ware, T. Rupert and Lucille Coleman Professor of Christian Theology, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br>&#x201c;This book explores the deepest recesses of the human heart. Why do we love what we do? Why do we choose what we do? Why can't we seem to change? From other guides, such an exploration could be depressing and scary or abstract and irrelevant. This book is different. Drawing from a deep grasp of the gospel and years of experience with people, Jeremy Pierre presents a wise, hopeful, joyful map for change.

He can take a wild, high-strung horse who has never before been handled and persuade that horse to accept a bridle, saddle, and rider in thirty minutes. His powers may seem like magic, but his amazing &#x201c;horse sense&#x201d; is based on a lifetime of experience. In <i>The Man Who Listens to Horses</i>, Roberts reveals his unforgettable personal story and his exceptional insight into nonverbal communication, an understanding that applies to human relationships as well. He shows that between parent and child, employee and employer, abuser and abused, there are forms of communication far stronger than the spoken word that are accessible to all who will learn to listen. This new edition features engaging photographs, a chapter that traces Roberts&#x2019;s amazing experience gentling with a mustang in the wild, and an Afterword about the remarkable impact this book has had on the world.</p><p>Monty Roberts is, as they say, the <i>real</i> horse whisperer--even if he does revile the last third of Nicholas Evans's romance. Yet Roberts also makes clear from the start that listening and close attention have more to do with gentling an animal than soi-disant whispering. As far as he's concerned, silent communication can "effectively cross over the boundary between human (the ultimate fight animal) and horse (the flight animal). Using their language, their system of communication, I could create a strong bond of trust. I would achieve cross-species communication." And achieve it he does. After one short session, he has even the wildest stallion nickering with ungulate abandon. <p> Roberts's descriptions of "joining up," as he calls it with horses--as well as with the deer who cavort on his California farm like so many hyperintelligent Bambis--are inspirational in the best sense of the word. Surprisingly, though, it took him long years to persuade most of the humans in his life that pain and punishment are not the way to go. Indeed, the author expends many a page on past mistakes and disasters, familial and professional. Yet <i>The Man Who Listens to Horses</i> remains a powerfully positive document--and not just for Mr. Ed. Best of all, when it comes to his life's work, Roberts is far more practical than mystical. Instead of portraying himself as Equus's messiah, he'd rather share his hard-won knowledge. Having overcome years of rejection and ridicule, the author is certainly not short in the self-esteem department, as some passages in this book demonstrate. No matter. He always checks his ego before entering the corral. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>"His portrait of the business of breeding and training horses is frank and fascinating, but the book's most memorable passages cover rodeos and horse business in the west as it was in the author's youth, and include a haunting portrait of his violent, racist father and some of the other remarkable figures Roberts knew (including a young James Dean). Over and above everything, though, is Roberts' surpassing love for horses, captured here in his evocations of the horses he has trained over a career spanning four decades."<br>--<b>Kirkus Reviews</b><p>"This book is important reading for those interested in communication, particularly interspecies communication and linguistics."<br>--<b>Publisher's Weekly</b></p><p>"Monty Roberts' book <b>The Man Who Listens to Horses</b> has inspired me to the depths of my soul. Observing Monty's philosophy and method of working with horses and people is one of the most profoundly deep, awe-inspiring, and heart-opening experiences I've ever witnessed. I highly recommend this book to everyone."<br>--Jack Canfield, co-author of the <b>Chicken Soup for the Soul</b> series</p></p><h2>Container Gardening: 250 Design Ideas &amp; Step-by-Step Techniques</h2><p><p>For people who don't have space or time for traditional gardening and who need expert advice on choosing and using plants and containers to create their own container garden, large or small.

In this addition to the Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture, respected New Testament scholar William Kurz offers a close reading and explanation of the entire narrative of Acts, grounded in the original Greek but keyed to the NABRE for liturgical use. This volume, like each in the series, relates Scripture to life, is faithfully Catholic, and is supplemented by features designed to help readers understand the Bible more deeply and use it more effectively.</p><p>"William Kurz, an accomplished biblical scholar, has a written a commentary on Acts that is up to date on current critical scholarship yet accessible to a wide audience of readers. Throughout the commentary one can see Kurz's clear understanding of the relationship of Acts to the first volume by the same author, the Gospel of Luke. Kurz is always positive in dealing with problem areas of the text. This work will be especially valuable for study groups, college students, and preachers of the Word."<br>--<b>Terence J. Keegan, OP</b>, professor of theology, Providence College<br><br>"In this volume, Kurz provides students and pastors a rare combination of careful scholarship and pastoral insight. Kurz writes as a seasoned Lukan scholar--a pioneer in narrative criticism--and implores the Church&nbsp;to extend&nbsp;Luke's vision concerning&nbsp;'all that Jesus began to do and teach .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to the ends of the earth.'"<br>--<b>Martin Mittelstadt</b>, professor of biblical studies, Evangel University<br><br>"Kurz sees the Acts narrative not just as a coherent story about the past--our Church's earliest moments of evangelistic mission--but also as a mirror the contemporary Church may peer into to see its deepest identity manifested within the stories of the major figures led by God to advance the Church's mission to the 'ends of the earth.' It is a great service to provide a commentary that is technically pristine, theologically alert, and pastorally sensitive."<br>--<b>Stephen Miletic</b>, professor of Scripture, Theology Department, Franciscan University of Steubenville<br><br>"In this book, Kurz provides necessary historical and cultural background while reading the text within the Church's tradition. He writes with the mind of a scholar and the heart of a pastor, all in an accessible style."<br>--<b>Martin C. Albl</b>, professor of religious studies, Presentation College, Aberdeen, South Dakota<br><br>"William Kurz combines the best of contemporary scholarship with the riches of tradition. His commentary is the fruit of a lifetime of work on Luke-Acts."<br>--<b>Jeremy Holmes</b>, academic dean and assistant professor of theology, Wyoming Catholic College<br><br>For more information on the series, visit <b>www.CatholicScriptureCommentary.com</b><b>William S.

He has served on the faculty of Stern College for Women, was field director of Military Chaplains, and traveled for the U. S. Department of Defense with the civilian equivalent of Major General. His chaplaincy duties took him around the world. One of his most important contributions has been the creation of the National Institute for Jewish Hospice."...a recognized classic that is as relevant today as it was when it was first published thirty years ago..." --<i>Malcolm Hoenlein,</i><br><br>"...will be read with wide interest and provide a gateway to an important rubric of Jewish thought and philosophy." --<i>Lord Immanuel</i></p><h2>Josephine Baker: The Hungry Heart</h2><p>This revelatory biography of Folies Bergere dancer Josephine Baker (1906-1975) is a study of struggle, truimph and tragedy.</p><p>Jean-Claude Baker spent years with his &#34;second mother&#34; Josephine Baker and her family on tour in Europe and America. Currently owner of the restaurant Chez Josephine, he lives in New York City. Chris Chase also lives in New York City.Latest and perhaps best of several recent bios of Josephine Baker (e.g., Phyllis Rose's Jazz Cleopatra, 1989)--this one by the performer's semiadopted/fully discarded son (owner of a Manhattan restaurant named Chez Josephine) and Chase (The Great American Waistline, 1981, etc.). Author Baker--who became the 13th member of Josephine's famous Rainbow Tribe of adopted children from all nations and colors--did all the research here (some 2,000 interviews and 3,000 letters), while Chase put his French into better-than-passable English. That this version of Josephine's life comes closest to the facts, and in no way hides behind a mask of academic research, is undeniable. The story is told by Jean-Claude, who sets the record straight on matters that his mother fibbed about in her several published autobiographies, as well as in the one left unfinished at her death. Josephine had lovers beyond number, which even she admitted, though her split with Jean-Claude came about when a Paris scandal- sheet falsely attributed to him the statement that she'd remarried yet again without benefit of divorce. The authors open with Josephine's colossal smash hit show in Paris at 19, which climaxed with her shamelessly bare-breasted, barbaric dance of seduction to a half-naked savage as she runs her hands all over him. Josephine, we learn, loved her body and spent a lot of time naked among hotel- room mirrors. We follow her through her St. Louis childhood--and her first marriage at 13 and second at 15--to her first big shows on Black Broadway and then to stardom in Paris. Bakermania erupts, her hair jell is a hit, she makes movies. Did she bed Picasso and Charles de Gaulle? Well...she died in bed at age 69, while reading fabulous reviews of her latest farewell appearance. No whitewash but sympathetic and gripping indeed.

In her completely frank and honest way, Anna had an astonishing ability to ask--and answer--life's largest questions, and to feel the purpose of being. You see, Anna had a very special friendship with Mr. God.<br>"Extraordinarily moving!"<br>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY</p><p><b>Fynn </b>is the pseudonym of Sydney George Hopkins, who wrote <i>Mister God, This Is Anna,</i>&nbsp;<i>Anna's Book, </i>and<i> Anna and the Black Knight</i>."The difference from a person and an angel is easy. Most of an angel is on<br>the inside and most of a person is on the outside." <br><br>These are the words of six-year-old Anna, sometimes called Mouse, Hum, or Joy. At five years old, Anna knew absolutely the purpose of being, knew the meaning of love, and<br>was a personal friend and helper of Mister God. At six, Anna was a theologian, mathematician, philosopher, poet, and gardener. If you asked her a question you would always get an answer--in due course. On some occasions the answer would be delayed for weeks or months; but eventually, in her own good time, the answer would come: direct, simple, and much to the point.<br><br>She never made eight years; she died by an accident. She died with a grin on her beautiful face. She died saying, "I bet Mister God lets me get into heaven for this." And I bet he did too.<br><br>I knew Anna for just about three and a half years. Some people lay claim<br>to fame by being the first person to sail around the world alone, or to<br>stand on the moon, or by some other act of bravery. All the world has<br>heard of such people. Not many people have heard of me, but I, too, have a claim<br>to fame; for I knew Anna. To me this was the high peak of adventure. This<br>was no casual knowing; it required total application. For I knew her on<br>her own terms, the way she demanded to be known: from the inside first.<br>"Most of an angel is in the inside," and this is the way I learned to know<br>her--my first angel. Since then I have learned to know two other angels,<br>but that's another story.<br><br>My name is Fynn. Well that's not quite true; my real name doesn't matter<br>all that much since my friends all called me Fynn and it stuck. If you<br>know your Irish mythology you will know that Fynn was pretty big; me too.<br>Standing about six feet two, weighing some 225 pounds, close to being a<br>fanatic on physical culture, the son of an Irish mother and a Welsh<br>father, with a passion for hot dogs and chocolate raisins--not together, I<br>may add. My great delight was to roam about dock-<br>land in the night-time, particularly if it was foggy.<br><br>My life with Anna began on such a night. I was nineteen at the time,<br>prowling the streets and alleys with my usual supply of hot dogs, the<br>street lights with their foggy halos showing dark formless shapes moving out from the darkness of the fog and disappearing again. Down the street a little way, a baker's shop window softened and warmed the raw night with its gas lamps. Sitting on the<br>grating under the window was a little girl. In those days children<br>wandering the streets at night were no uncommon sight. I had seen such<br>things before, but on this occasion it was different. How or why it was<br>different has long since been forgotten except that I am sure it was<br>different. I sat down beside her on the grating, my back against the shop<br>front. We stayed there about three hours. Looking back over thirty years,<br>I can now cope with those three hours; but at the time I was on the verge<br>of being destroyed. That November night was pure hell; my guts tied<br>themselves into all manner of complicated knots.<br><br>Perhaps even then something of her angelic nature caught hold of me; I'm<br>quite prepared to believe that I had been bewitched from the beginning. I<br>sat down with "Shove up a bit, Tich." She shoved up a bit but made no<br>comment.<br><br>"Have a hot dog," I said.<br><br>She shook her head and answered, "It's yours."<br><br>"I got plenty. Besides, I'm full up," I said.<br><br>She made no sign, so I put the bag on&nbsp;&nbsp;the grating between us. The light from the shop window wasn't very strong and the kid was sitting in the shadows so I couldn't see what she looked like except that she was very dirty. I could see that she clutched under<br>one arm a rag doll and on her lap a battered old paint box.<br><br>We sat there for thirty minutes or so in complete silence; during that<br>time I thought there had been a movement of her hand toward the hot dog<br>bag but I didn't want to look or comment in case I put her off. Even now I<br>can feel the immense pleasure I had when I heard the sound of that hot dog<br>skin popping under the bite of her teeth. A minute or two later she took a<br>second and then a third. I reached into my pocket and brought out a packet<br>of Woodbines.<br><br>"Do you mind if I smoke while you're eating, Tich?" I asked.<br><br>"What?" She sounded a little alarmed.<br><br>"Can I have a cigarette while you're eating?"<br><br>She rolled over and got to her knees and looked me in the face.<br><br>"Why?" she said.<br><br>"My Mum's a stickler for politeness. Besides, you don't blow smoke in a<br>lady's face when she's eating," I said.<br><br>She stared at half a hot dog for a moment or two, and looking at me fully,<br>she said, "Why? Do you like me?"<br><br>I nodded.<br><br>"You have a cigarette then," and she smiled at me and popped the rest of<br>the hot dog into her mouth.<br><br>I took out a Woodbine and lit up and offered her the match to blow out.<br>She blew, and I was sprayed with bits of hot dog. This little accident<br>produced such a reaction in her that I felt that I had been stabbed in the<br>guts. I had seen a dog cringe before, but never a child. The look she gave<br>me filled me with horror. She expected a thrashing. She clenched her teeth<br>as she waited for me to strike her.<br><br>What my face registered I don't know, perhaps anger and violence, or shock<br>and confusion. Whatever it was, it produced from her the most piteous<br>whimper. I can't describe this sound after all these years; no words are fitting. The feeling I can still taste, can still experience. My heart faltered at the sound, and<br>something came undone inside me. My clenched fist hit the pavement beside<br>me, a useless gesture in response to Anna's fears. Did I think of that<br>image then, that image which I now think of, the only one that fits the<br>occasion? That perfection of violence, that ultimate horror and<br>bewilderment of Christ crucified. That terrible sound that the child made<br>was a sound that I never wish to hear again. It attacked my emotional<br>being and blew a fuse.<br><br>After a moment or two I laughed. I suppose that the human mind can only<br>stand so much grief and anguish. After that, the fuses blow. With me, the<br>fuses blew in a big way. The next few minutes I know very little<br>about--except that I laughed and laughed. Then I realized that the kid was<br>laughing too. No shrunken bundle of fear--she was laughing. Kneeling on the<br>pavement and leaning forward with her face close to mine, and<br>laughing--laughing. So very many times in the next three years I heard <br>her laughter--no silver bells or sweet rippling sounds was her laughter,<br>but like a five-year-old's bellow of delight, a cross between a puppy's<br>yelp, a motorbike, and a bicycle pump.<br><br>I put my hands on her shoulders and held her off at arm's length, and then<br>came that look that is entirely Anna's--mouth wide open, eyes popping out<br>of her head, like a whippet straining at the leash. Every fiber of that<br>little body was vibrating and making a delicious sound. Legs and arms,<br>toes and fingers, the whole of that little body shook and trembled like<br>Mother Earth giving birth to a volcano. And what a volcano was released in<br>that child!<br><br>Outside that baker's shop in dockland on a foggy November night I had the<br>unusual experience of seeing a child born. After the laughter had quieted<br>off a bit, but while her little body was still thrumming like a violin<br>string, she tried to say something, but it wouldn't come out properly. She<br>managed a "You--You--You--."<br><br>After some little time and a great deal of effort she managed, "You love<br>me, don't you?"<br><br>Even had it not been true, I could not have said no to save my life; true<br>or false, right or wrong, there was only one answer. I said yes.<br><br>She gave a little giggle, and pointing a finger at me, said, "You love<br>me," and then broke into some primitive gyration around the lamppost,<br>chanting, "You love me. You love me. You love me."<br><br>Five minutes of this and she came back and sat down on the grating. "It's<br>nice and warm for your bum, ain't it?" she said.<br><br>I agreed it was nice for your bum.<br><br>A moment later: "I ain't arf firsty." So we upped and went along to the<br>pub just down the road. I bought a large bottle of stout. She wanted "one<br>of them ginger pops with the marble in the neck." So she had two ginger<br>pops and some more hot dogs from an all-night coffee stall.<br><br>"Let's go back and get our bums warm again," she grinned at me. Back we<br>went and sat on the grating, a big un and a little un.<br><br>I don't suppose that we drank more than a half of the drinks, for it<br>seemed that the idea of a fizzy drink was to shake it vigorously and then<br>let it shoot up into the air. After a few showers of ginger pop and a<br>determined effort to do the nose trick, she said, "Now do it to yourn."<br><br>I'm sure even then that this was not a request but an order. I shook hard<br>and long and then let fly with the stopper and we both were covered with<br>frothy stout.<br><br>The next hour was filled with giggles and hot dogs, ginger pop and<br>chocolate raisins. The occasional passerby was yelled at: "Oi, Mister, he<br>loves me, he do." Running up the steps of a nearby building she shouted,<br>"Look at me. I'm bigger than you."</p><h2>Old Lady on the Trail: Triple Crown at 76</h2><p>Adventure on National Scenic Trails does not need to end when one is old.

The modern American hospital is that establishment and <i>Unaccountable </i>is that book."--Shannon Brownlee, author of Overtreated<br><br> Dr. Marty Makary is co-developer of the life-saving checklist outlined in Atul Gawande's bestseller The Checklist Manifesto. A Johns Hopkins surgeon and professor of public health, he can testify to the amazing power of modern medicine to cure. But he's also been a witness to a a system that frustrates doctors and patients alike.&nbsp; Dr. Makary describes the problem and presents disruptive innovations from success stories around the U.S.&nbsp; The ideas are powerful, but even more important, they are home-grown by the doctors on the front-lines of American healthcare.

Now they lead to Beijing." So argues Peter Frankopan in this revelatory new book.<br><br>In the age of Brexit and Trump, the West is buffeted by the tides of isolationism and fragmentation. Yet to the East, this is a moment of optimism as a new network of relationships takes shape along the ancient trade routes. In <i>The New Silk Roads</i>, Peter Frankopan takes us on an eye-opening journey through the region, from China's breathtaking infrastructure investments to the flood of trade deals among Central Asian republics to the growing rapprochement between Turkey and Russia. This important book asks us to put aside our preconceptions and see the world from a new--and ultimately hopeful--perspective.</p><p>PETER FRANKOPAN is professor of global history at Oxford University. He is the author of <i>The First Crusade: The Call from the East</i> and <i>The Silk Roads: A New History of the World</i>. He lives in Oxford.<b>The Roads to the East</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Twenty-five years ago, when I was about to leave university, the world seemed a different place. The Cold War was over, leading to hopes for peace and prosperity. &#x201c;The heroic deeds of Boris Yeltsin and the Russian people&#x201d; had steered Russia onto a course of reform and democracy, said President Bill Clinton at a meeting with the Russian president in Vancouver in 1993. The prospect of a &#x201c;newly productive and prosperous Russia&#x201d; was good for everyone, he noted.<br><br> Hopeful times lay ahead too in South Africa, where fraught negotiations to end apartheid had advanced sufficiently for the Nobel committee to award the Peace Prize for 1993 to F. W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela for &#x201c;their work for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime, and for laying the founda�tions for a new democratic South Africa.&#x201d; The award of the prestigious prize was a moment of hope for South Africa, for Africa and for the world&#x2014;even if it later emerged that many of Mandela&#x2019;s closest confidants urged him not to accept the prize if it meant having to share it with a man they referred to as &#x201c;his oppressor.&#x201d; Mandela insisted, however, that forgiveness was a vital part of reconciliation.<br><br> Things looked promising in the Korean peninsula, where, in an echo of the discussions that took place in 2018, an out�line agreement was reached between the US and North Korea to great fanfare about the peaceful reunification of Korea and about a pathway for denuclearisation that was welcomed as a significant step forward for non-proliferation and also for a safer region and for a safer world.<br><br> In 1993, an important agreement was also reached between China and India that established the framework for dealing with disputed border issues that had been a source of rivalry and bitterness for three decades&#x2014;while both sides also agreed to reduce troop levels along the frontier and work together towards a conclusion that was mutually acceptable. This was important for both countries at a time when economic expan�sion and liberalisation was at the forefront for their respective political leaders. In China, Deng Xiaoping had recently under�taken a tour of the southern provinces to press for faster social, political and financial reforms, and to deal with hardliners who opposed the liberalisation of markets that had seen the stock exchange open in communist China in Shanghai in 1990.<br><br> South Korea&#x2019;s transformation was already well under way. In the 1960s, the country had been one of the poorest in the world, with no natural resources and an unpromising location at the eastern extremity of Asia. Its transformation into an eco�nomic superpower that is home to companies like Samsung, Hyundai Motor and Hanwha Corporation&#x2014;each of which has more than $100bn in assets&#x2014;has led some commentators to talk of South Korea as &#x201c;the most successful country in the world.&#x201d;<br><br> In India, as elsewhere, there was a push for growth in the early 1990s&#x2014;although few expected much from a small software company that struggled to list its stock in Mumbai in Febru�ary 1993. Despite its size and potential, India was an economic minnow and the technology sector was tiny and untested. Those who were brave and bought shares in Infosys Technologies did well if they held on to their stock. The company reported an operating profit for the year ended 31 March 2018 of over $2.6bn. Shares were worth turnover of more than $10bn. Shares were worth 4,000 times more than they had been twenty-five years earlier.<br><br> The foundation of a new airline in a small Gulf State seemed like a long shot, too. Founded in November 1993, Qatar Air�ways began operating two months later in what many assumed would be a modest operation that handled a few local routes, for which demand would be minimal. Today, the airline has a fleet of over 200 aircraft, more than 40,000 staff and flies to over 150 destinations&#x2014;winning armfuls of accolades that few would have thought possible two and a half decades ago. In April 2018, it agreed to buy 25 per cent of the shares of Moscow&#x2019;s Vnukovo International Airport&#x2014;the third largest in Russia.<br><br> Of course, good news did not abound everywhere in 1993, as a truck bomb at the World Trade Center in New York and a coordinated series of bombings in Mumbai that killed more than 250 people showed. Sarajevo, a city already famous for the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and the road to war in 1914 endured a siege by Bosnian Serb forces that lasted longer than the Battle of Stalingrad during the Second World War. Scenes of snipers shooting at civilians as they crossed the streets became commonplace, as did terrible images of the devastation caused by mortars being fired into the city from the neighbouring hills. The reappearance of concentration camps in Europe, and of genocide at Srebrenica and Gorazde in the mid-1990s, provided a brutal reminder that even the most horrifying lessons from the past can be easily forgotten.<br><br> Some of the troubles of the early 1990s were more familiar. In Britain, for example, political discourse was shaped by poi�sonous debates about membership in the European Union and calls for a referendum. These almost brought down the govern�ment, and led to the prime minister, John Major, referring to members of his own cabinet as &#x201c;bastards.&#x201d;<br><br> *<br><br> These events are all in the recent past. And yet they now feel distant and seem to evoke a different age. I listened to an album called <i>Pablo Honey </i>by a promising new band called Radiohead as I prepared for my final exams in the summer of 1993. Little did I know that the most prophetic song of the year was not &#x201c;Creep&#x201d;&#x2014;which has gone on to have been streamed more than a quarter of a billion times on Spotify&#x2014;but one that won at the Oscars that year. &#x201c;A whole new world,&#x201d; Aladdin promised Jasmine, &#x201c;a new fantastic point of view.&#x201d; Indeed, she agreed. &#x201c;A whole new world, a dazzling place I never knew.&#x201d; A song based on a story from and set along the past of the Silk Roads foretold its future.<br><br> That whole new world can be seen nowhere more clearly than by comparing the game of football in England in 1993 and today. A week before finals started in Cambridge, I watched a replay of the FA Cup final between Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday, which was almost as dull and dour as the drawn first match. Of the players who featured in the match (including sub�stitutes), all but three came from the British Isles. Twenty-five years later, the final between Chelsea and Manchester United was an equally underwhelming occasion&#x2014;but the composition of the teams was radically different: just six of the twenty-seven who played at Wembley were born in the United Kingdom or Ireland. The others came from all over the world, including Spain, France, Nigeria and Ecuador.<br><br> If that tells a story about the pace of globalisation in the course of a generation, then perhaps even more striking is the dramatic change in the ownership of English football clubs over the same period. Not long ago, the idea that leading teams would have foreign owners would have been dismissed as the stuff of fantasy&#x2014;at a time when even a foreign accent in the boardroom would have had club directors spluttering into their tea and choking on their pork pies at half-time. But today, many of the most famous names in English and European football have owners from abroad. And many come from the lands of the Silk Roads.<br><br> In some ways, that is not surprising. After all, although the game was codified in London in 1863, football was not invented in England. According to FIFA, the international body that gov�erns the sport, football was first attested in Han-dynasty China (206 bc&#x2013;ad 220), where a game that involved players kicking a leather ball filled with feathers into a net held up by two bam�boo rods was known as <i>cuju</i>.<br><br> Even so, it is a long way to go from the origins of the game to noting that all the great teams from in and around Birmingham&#x2014;including Aston Villa, West Bromwich Albion, Birmingham City and Wolverhampton Wanderers&#x2014;have been bought by Chinese owners since <i>The Silk Roads </i>was published in 2015. In 2017, meanwhile, two of the giants of Italian foot�ball that share the magnificent San Siro stadium&#x2014; AC and Inter Milan&#x2014;were also sold to Chinese buyers.<br><br> Then there are the owners of England&#x2019;s&#x2014;and Europe&#x2019;s&#x2014;finest teams who come from the Gulf. Manchester City, who dominated all domestic competition to win the English Pre�mier League in 2018 by a record margin, are owned by Man�sour bin Zayed al Nayhan, who is also deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates. The team has a parallel in Paris Saint-Germain, who strolled to the French Ligue 1 title in the same year with equal ease, and whose Qatari owners were able to provide the team with two new players&#x2014;Neymar and Kylian Mbapp�&#x2014;by signing them the previous summer for transfer fees that exceeded more than &#x20ac;350m (before salaries and bonuses).<br><br> Everton FC&#x2019;s majority owner is Farhad Moshiri, who was born in Iran but now lives in Monaco, who made his fortune working alongside Alisher Usmanov, a businessman from Uzbekistan, whose investments in Russia, Central Asia and else�where have made him worth more than $15bn&#x2014;and enabled him to buy a significant stake in Arsenal Football Club. For a time, Usmanov wanted to buy control, but was thwarted by the complex shareholder structure. Arsenal fans had pleaded with him not to sell his shares before he finally disposed of them in the summer of 2018. But for years, the fate of a proud and famous football club hung on the decision of an Uzbek magnate.<br><br> Once upon a time, rich Englishmen would head to Europe as part of the Grand Tour, frolicking in cities like Venice, Naples, Florence and Rome, admiring and being inspired by their art and architecture, and with some buying up paintings, drawings, sculptures, manuscripts and even entire contents of houses to take home with them. These were the spoils of the rising wealth and commercial and military success that turned a small island in the North Atlantic into a global superpower. Now the trophies to show off are the World Cup football tour�nament, successfully bid for by Russia and Qatar, the Winter Olympics (held at Sochi in 2014) and magnificent art galleries&#x2014;such as the new Louvre, located not in Paris but Abu Dhabi, or the new V&amp;A museum that is not in London&#x2019;s Albertopolis but in Shenzhen. Then there is the stunning Rem Koolhaas-designed Garage Museum of Modern Art in Moscow, or the Winter Sports Complex in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, a venue that is considerably bigger than Madison Square Garden.<br><br> In the eighteenth century, one British traveller set off on his journey to Italy &#x201c;being impatiently desirous of viewing a coun�try so famous in history, which once gave laws to the world.&#x201d; Today that has changed, and now it is Britain&#x2019;s history that has come to be admired, its laws and its courts used to settle dis�putes and agree divorce settlements, and its trophies hunted and bought by the new great and good&#x2014;such as football clubs or statement assets like world-famous flagship stores Harrods and Hamleys, Canary Wharf, &#x201c;the Walkie-Talkie&#x201d; building at 20 Fenchurch Street in the City, or media outlets like the <i>Inde�pendent </i>and the <i>Evening Standard</i>, all of which have owners with Chinese, Russian or Emirati backgrounds.<br><br> It is the same story in the United States, where the Brook�lyn Nets basketball franchise, the <i>New York Post</i>, the Waldorf Astoria and the Plaza Hotel in New York, and Warner Music are just some of the flagship businesses and brands that have been bought outright or as partnerships by investors both from and with close links to Russia, the Middle East and China.<br><br> These also include, as it happens, Legendary Entertain�ment, the Hollywood studio behind <i>Jurassic Park</i>, which was the box-office smash of the summer of 1993&#x2014;and one of the rewards I enjoyed after finishing my exams. That is now part of Wang Jianlin&#x2019;s Dalian Wanda Group Company&#x2014;which also owns the Odeon, UCI, Carmike and Hoyts cinema chains in Europe, the US and Australia (with a total of more than 14,000 screens), as well as Sunseeker yachts and Infront Sports and Media&#x2014;which holds the exclusive broadcast rights to sporting events that include the 2018 and 2022 football World Cup.<br><br> Naturally, while some of these businesses might qualify as hobbies and passions to be indulged, many represent serious as well as big-ticket investments. They are based on a great move�ment of global GDP over the last twenty-five years, with more than 800 million being lifted above the poverty line since the 1980s in China alone. While the setting of what constitutes &#x201c;poverty&#x201d; is a matter of debate for development economists and others, there can be little doubt that the pace as well as the extent of China&#x2019;s growth is astonishing. In 2001, China&#x2019;s GDP was 39 per cent of that of the US (on a purchasing power par�ity); that rose to 62 per cent by 2008. By 2016, China&#x2019;s GDP was 114 per cent that of the United States, measured on the same basis&#x2014;and is likely to rise both further and sharply in the next five years.</p><h2>The Urban Sketching Handbook Working with Color: Techniques for Using Watercolor and Color Media on the Go (Volume 7) (Urban Sketching Handbooks, 7)</h2><p><b>Learn to express yourself through color while painting on location with the in-depth tips and techniques of <i>Working with Color</i>,&nbsp;the fifth volume in the Urban Sketching Handbook series.</b><br><br> Expert watercolorist, illustrator,&nbsp;instructor, and co-founder of Urban Sketchers Montreal Shari Blaukopf&nbsp;shares her <b>essential color tips</b> about color-water ratio, achieving bold color, avoiding muddy washes, painting in layers, and using wet-in-wet techniques.<br><br> This essential handbook covers:<ul><li>supplies and materials</li><li>sample color palettes</li><li>color mixing</li><li>using limited palettes</li><li>monochrome sketches</li><li>the power of complementary colors</li><li>using evocative, expressive color</li></ul>With a focus on <b>using watercolor with greater confidence and knowledge</b>, the book also delves into <b>pencil and ink</b>&nbsp;and water-soluble pencils.<br> &nbsp;<br> The instructional text is enhanced with <b>stunning watercolor illustrations</b> by the author and other expert urban sketchers from beautiful locations around the globe.

Now, in his first book written for a wide audience, he offers a marvelous biography of the Prophet Muhammad, one that highlights the spiritual and ethical teachings of one of the most influential figures in human history. <p></p><em>In the Footsteps of the Prophet</em> is a fresh and perceptive look at Muhammad, capturing a life that was often eventful, gripping, and highly charged. Ramadan provides both an intimate portrait of a man who was shy, kind, but determined, as well as a dramatic chronicle of a leader who launched a great religion and inspired a vast empire. More important, Ramadan presents the main events of the Prophet's life in a way that highlights his spiritual and ethical teachings. The book underscores the significance of the Prophet's example for some of today's most controversial issues, such as the treatment of the poor, the role of women, Islamic criminal punishments, war, racism, and relations with other religions.

Rise above the magnetic pull of the refrigerator and turn to the bounty offered to thousands who have embraced a liberating weight-reduction program in churches across America. </i>The Weigh Down Diet<i> gives new hope to millions who have failed on conventional diets and guides readers to the richer satisfaction that comes not from food, but from faith.<br><br></i>Gwen Shamblin&#x2019;s <i>The Weigh Down Diet </i>is a groundbreaking approach to weight loss. People who have known no end to their hunger and who have no control over their late-night binges have learned through the Weigh Down Workshop that they can remove the irresistible desire for food. This is not a diet like others, because it is not food-focused. It contains chapters such as &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Not Genetics or Your Mother&#x2019;s Fault,&#x201d; &#x201c;I Feel Hungry All the Time,&#x201d; and &#x201c;How to Eat Potato Chips and Chocolate.&#x201d; So, as you can see, here is a very different approach to weight loss. <i>Weigh Down</i> gives back hope to dieters who will learn that God did not put chocolate or lasagna on Earth to torture us &#x2013; but rather for our enjoyment!</p><p>"We have been trying to feed our hurting, longing hearts with physical food," writes Gwen Shamblin, registered dietician and founder of the Weigh Down program, which emphasizes "God's power--not 'will power.'" This book offers instruction on how to eat only when physically hungry, how to "nourish the soul with a relationship with God," and how not to confuse different hunger urges. The diet plan teaches you not to overeat by letting you eat exactly what you want, but much less of it. <p> The key is to understand hunger, recognize fullness, and sense what your body is really calling for. You learn to "rate" food by its appeal, and eat your favorite foods first, stopping when you're getting full (not waiting until you're stuffed). This is not a nutritional guide; in fact, Shamblin's own sample menu is high in fat, cholesterol, sugar, and salt. <i>The Weigh Down Diet</i> is, however, a guide to using your religious beliefs to help you stop overeating and see food in a new light. This book inspires you with scriptural passages, discussions of "God's rules" about eating, and assurances that God's love will help you win your battle with weight.</p>You can now join the thousands who have discovered a liberating new weight control plan and are turning to God to take away the desire to overeat. The Weigh Down Workshop, a remarkable program which already has thousands of support groups across the country and has gained national attention in media from "A Current Affair" to <i>Woman's Day</i>, is now available as a book. What makes this ground-breaking approach to weight loss so unique is that participants can eat any kind of food-including fats and sweets--and be able to stop in the middle of a candy bar when their stomachs are full.<p></p><p>People who have known no end to fullness and who have no control over their late-night binges have learned through the Weigh Down Method that God can remove the seemingly irresistible pull of the pantry and drive-thru restaurants. With this approach, participants can reduce the volume of food they want to one-third of what it used to be and yet still eat with fulfilled satisfaction. Yet this is not a diet like others you've seen. Dieting only increases chewing whereas with the Weigh Down approach, you will chew less food, but more importantly, with God's help-want less food. Quite simply, this approach equals weight loss. <i>Weigh Down</i> gives back hope; hope to dieters who will learn that they are not a failure. Stop torturing yourself. God did not put chocolate or lasagna on earth to torture us--but rather for our enjoyment! Hallelujah!</p></p><h2>The Planets in Full Score (Dover Orchestral Music Scores)</h2><p><p>Among the most popular and important modern British composers, Gustav Holst (1874&#x2013;1934) was a true eccentric, given to odd enthusiasms and mystical musings. His spectacular symphonic suite <i>The Planets</i>, first performed in 1918, established his international reputation and remains a staple of the orchestral repertoire to this day.<br>Scored for huge orchestral forces and a wordless chorus, the work is divided into seven movements, the music of each embodying the astrological and mystical qualities of a different planet. From the ominous, relentless march of "Mars, the Bringer of War" to the robust festivities of "Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity" and the weird, unearthly hush of "Neptune, the Mystic," the emotional sweep and innovative techniques of the suite have delighted and thrilled its vast audience ever since its spectacular debut.

This community is based on the work of Gin Stephens and her original book: Delay, Don&#x2019;t Deny: Living an Intermittent Fasting Lifestyle. In today&#x2019;s app-based world, some of us are old-school, and we prefer a paper and pencil approach. This journal is a tool for us! The Delay, Don&#x2019;t Deny LIFE Journal is packed with simple yet powerful tools that will allow you to interact with your thoughts and track your results in a way that works for you. You can pick and choose from among the many options for both reflecting and tracking. This LIFE journal includes sections for motivational and reflective entries, such as &#x201c;Non-Scale Victories&#x201d; and &#x201c;Affirmations&#x201d;. There is a section for goal setting, a reflective food journal, and a traditional journal, where you can respond to the original 30 journal prompts from DDD (or create your own unique prompts, based on what is meaningful to you). Interested in tracking your fasting time and/or eating window length? There are a couple of places where you can do that. First, there is a &#x201c;Fasting Tracker&#x201d;, where you can shade in your daily eating windows and/or fasting periods. You can also take more detailed notes about your daily eating window in the &#x201c;Weekly Calendar and Planner&#x201d; section. If you exercise, you can note that in the &#x201c;Movement Journal&#x201d;. If you use the scale, there is a section to record your daily weight and calculate your weekly average. Then, you can plot it on the weight loss tracking graph. You can create personalized weight loss milestones, and shade in your progress as you reach each one. In addition to (or instead of) tracking progress using the scale, you may want to record your measurements and see how those change over time. Many IFers find that they lose inches before pounds, and measuring is a great way to illustrate this type of progress. There is also a section for you to include progress photos, which are a fantastic way to see just how much your body is changing from month to month. Finally, there is a &#x201c;Custom&#x201d; section, which you can use in any way that works for you. This is a place for you to take notes, or create your own user-specific record or reflection pages.

Some of his keyboards can play <i>piano</i>, light and soft; others make <i>forte</i> notes ring out, strong and loud, but Cristofori longs to create an instrument that can be played both soft and loud.<br> <br>His talent has caught the attention of Prince Ferdinando de Medici, who wants his court to become the musical center of Italy. The prince brings Cristofori to the noisy city of Florence, where the goldsmiths&#x2019; tiny hammers whisper <i>tink, tink</i> and the blacksmiths&#x2019; big sledgehammers shout <i>BANG, BANG!</i> Could hammers be the key to the new instrument?<br> <br>At last Cristofori gets his creation just right. It is called the pianoforte, for what it can do. All around the world, people young and old can play the most intricate music of their lives, thanks to Bartolomeo Cristofori&#x2019;s marvelous creation: the piano.</p><p>Elizabeth Rusch is an award-winning children&#x2019;s book author and magazine writer.

She lives in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.K-Gr 3&#x2014;A well-researched, fascinating account of the father of modern-day pianos. Bartolomeo Cristofori was a talented 17th-century inventor born in Padua, Italy, who loved the light and powerful sounds of the clavichord and the harpsichord. He longed to create an instrument that married both of these kinds of notes. With the patronage of Prince Ferdinando de' Medici, Cristofori was able to spend the rest of his life tinkering away in his quest for what would eventually become the pianoforte. Rusch's energetic text is paired well with Priceman's vibrant images, rendered in gouache and ink with bold strokes. Each spread is introduced by a musical term, defined in parentheses, that not only sets up the narrative that will be showcased on those pages but also introduces readers to piano-playing techniques (e.g., forte, pianissimo, crescendo). The curly and bold font used for these headings adds to the dynamic layout of each page and illustrates the lively music that the piano inspires. Quotations from and about Cristofori are peppered throughout. In addition to a detailed time line and source notes, the thorough back matter includes author's notes on the few updates that have been made since Cristofori's pianos, where children can find his remaining instruments, a list of classical and modern music pieces that make great use of the piano, and how Rusch was able to reconstruct the inventor's life from primary and secondary sources. VERDICT A strong purchase for music lovers, budding pianists, and large biography and STEAM collections.&#x2014;Shelley M.

Nothing less than a major contribution to the scientific culture of this world." &#x2014; <i>The New York Times Book Review<br></i>This major survey of mathematics, featuring the work of 18 outstanding Russian mathematicians and including material on both elementary and advanced levels, encompasses 20 prime subject areas in mathematics in terms of their simple origins and their subsequent sophisticated developement. As Professor Morris Kline of&nbsp; New York University noted, "This unique work presents the amazing panorama of&nbsp; mathematics proper. It is the best answer in print to what mathematics contains both on the elementary and advanced levels."<br>Beginning with an overview and analysis of mathematics, the first of three major divisions of the book progresses to an exploration of analytic geometry, algebra, and ordinary differential equations. The second part introduces partial differential equations, along with theories of curves and surfaces, the calculus of variations, and functions of a complex variable. It furthur examines prime numbers, the theory of probability, approximations, and the role of computers in mathematics. The theory of functions of a real variable opens the final section, followed by discussions of linear algebra and nonEuclidian geometry, topology, functional&nbsp; analysis, and groups and other algebraic systems.<br>Thorough, coherent explanations of each topic are further augumented by numerous illustrative figures, and every chapter concludes with a suggested reading list. Formerly issued as a three-volume set, this mathematical masterpiece is now available in a convenient and modestly priced one-volume edition, perfect for study or reference.<br>"This is a masterful&nbsp;English translation of a stupendous and formidable mathematical masterpiece . . ." &#x2014; <i>Social Science</i></p><p><p><b>The Russian Equation <br></b>Representative of the tremendous impact which Russian mathematicians have had on the Dover list since the Sputnik era is this outstanding book edited by A.

The coverage is extremely wide, including such important areas as linear algebra, group theory, functional analysis, ordinary and partial differential equations, the theory of functions of real and complex variables, and related subjects. . . . What makes these volumes so readable as compared with usual mathematics textbooks is the emphasis here upon basic concepts and results rather than upon the intricate and wearying proofs that make such demands in conventional textbooks and courses. There are proofs in these volumes, but usually they are presented only for the most important results, and even then to emphasize key areas and to illustrate the kind of methodology employed. . . . It is hard to imagine that any intelligent American with a curious mind and some good recollection of his high school and college mathematics would not find many entrancing discoveries in the intellectual gold mine that is this work." &#x2014; <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> </p><p> </p><p>"An excellent reference set for bright high school students and beginning college students . . . also of value to their teachers for lucid discussions and many good elementary examples in both familiar and unfamiliar branches.

Trust Surrender Receive: How MDMA Can Release Us from Trauma and PTSD briefly chronicles the medical, legal, and social history of this misunderstood medicine, but its primary focus is to give a taste of how MDMA actually works from inside the experience, through the written and spoken words of firsthand testimonial accounts. The book takes readers through the healing processes of more than forty individuals who, often after many years of personal struggle, chose to take responsibility for their condition by turning to the medicine. In this way, accompanied by an experienced attendant, they have been able to revisit their trauma from a buffered distance and to find lasting release.

Always a difficult vocation, changes in society and the church in recent years have made the ordained life all the more complex and challenging. Is the pastor primarily a preacher, a professional caregiver, an administrator? Given the call of all Christians to be ministers to the world, what is the distinctive ministry of the ordained? When does one's ministry take on the character of prophet, and when does it become that of priest? What are the special ethical obligations and disciplines of the ordained?<br> <br> <em>Pastor: Revised Edition</em> explores these and other central questions about the vocation of ordained ministry. It begins with a discussion of who pastors are, asking about the theological underpinnings of ordained ministry, and then moves on to what pastors do, looking at the distinctive roles the pastor must fulfill. The book also draws on great teachers of the Christian tradition to demonstrate that, while much about Christian ministry has changed, its core concerns&#x2014;preaching the word, the care of souls, the sacramental life of congregations&#x2014;remains the same.<br> <br> Ordained ministry is a vocation to which we are called, not a profession that we choose. To answer that call is to open oneself to heartache and sometimes hardship; yet, given the one who calls, it is to make oneself available to deep and profound joy as well.</p><p>A comprehensive guide to the joys and challenges of pastoral ministry by one of today&#39;s foremost preachers. &#34;For anyone who is working out &#39;with fear and trembling&#39; what it means to be in ministry, this book is a gift. Will Willimon&#39;s book is solid theology with a profound understanding of Scripture for this ministerial calling.&#34; --Tony Campolo, Eastern College &#34;Pastors are a battered breed these days. Images and impressions range from cheap to glittering to dogged. Will Willimon will have none of it; he counters with an enormous infusion of dignity, but it is dignity without a trace of pomposity. By articulating our baptismal, biblical, and theological foundations, he trumps a demeaning culture and a trivializing church, and restores honor to our vocations.&#34; --Eugene H. Peterson, Professor Emeritus of Spiritual Theology, Regent College. &#34;There is great confusion these days about the role and function of a Protestant pastor. Writing out of his deep knowledge of Scripture and church history, and out of his long experience in the pastorate, Willimon furnishes some clear and compelling answers. I would recommend that every pastor and seminarian read, study, and reflect on this book.&#34; Elizabeth Achtemeier, Union Theological Seminary in Virginia &#34;Pastor is the crowning achievement of Willimon&#39;s years of experience and research. It covers everything, from one&#39;s calling to ministry to every facet of personal and pastoral work with thoroughness and evangelical passion. Anyone who follows this theologically grounded, deeply practical guide will experience a rebirth of their calling and evolution of their ministry.&#34; Robert Webber, Northern SeminaryFeeling most at home behind a pulpit, Will Willimon&#x2019;s deepest calling is to be a preacher and truth-teller of Jesus Christ.

Known for unveiling unseen worlds, scientific breakthroughs, and historical secrets, Rollins' knack for breakneck pacing and stunning originality has been hailed by critics and embraced by scores of millions of readers around the world.<br><br><b> The Critics Rave</b><br><br> The New York Times says that his "roguish charm comes from his efforts to persuade readers the story is credible [through] real-life sources for his novel's science, history and geography." Rollins' rare blend of action, suspense, and knowledge was also mentioned by the Huffington Post, which stated that "After Crichton passed away in 2008 he clearly passed the baton to James Rollins, who like Crichton, is a renaissance man."<br><br> NPR calls his work "adventurous and enormously engrossing..." and the New York Journal of Books had this to say: "If you're a fan of smart, entertaining adventure fiction, this is your summer beach read writ large....All the science, all the history, and all the locations are masterfully intertwined. The characters are multi-dimensional. And the story is, well, a corker."<br><br><b> The Story Teller's Story</b><br><br> As a boy immersed in the scientific adventures of Doc Savage, the wonders of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and pulps such as The Shadow, The Spider, and The Avenger, James Rollins decided he wanted to be a writer. He honed his storytelling skills early, spinning elaborate tales that were often at the heart of pranks played on his brothers and sisters.<br><br> Before he would set heroes and villains on harrowing adventures, Rollins embarked on a career in veterinary medicine, graduating from the University of Missouri and establishing a successful veterinary practice. This hands-on knowledge of medicine and science helps shape the research and scientific speculation that set James Rollins books apart.<br><br><b> Explosive Page-Turning Adventures</b><br><br> The exotic locales of James Rollins novels have emerged as a hybrid between imagination, research, and his extensive travels throughout the United States and Europe, as well as New Zealand, the South Pacific, China, Southeast Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America. Recent jaunts include book tours and stops across the country and several European nations to give talks, seminars, and media interviews. In recent years, much of James' travel has involved meeting readers in small and large groups, at writing and fan conferences, and even aboard seagoing "seminars." James' mentoring and coaching skills have made him a sought after writing instructor and guest speaker for workshops, symposia, conventions, and other forums throughout the country.<br><br> James Rollins is the author of nine thrillers in the bestselling Sigma Force series (Sandstorm, Map of Bones, Black Order, The Judas Strain, The Last Oracle, The Doomsday Key, The Devil Colony, Bloodline, and The Eye of God); six individual adventure thrillers; and the Jake Ransom middle grade series (Jake Ransom and the Skull King's Shadow, Jake Ransom and the Howling Sphinx.)Explore the wildly inventive, thrill-ride adventure set deep in the mysterious jungles of South America from <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author James Rollins<br><br> Excavation<br><br> While on an expedition to Peru, archeologist Dr. Henry Conklin makes several startling discoveries.

D'Amato died a year before Tyson became the youngest heavyweight champion in history.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Tyson&#x2019;s bestselling memoir <i>Undisputed Truth</i>, he recounted the role D&#x2019;Amato played in his formative years, adopting him at age sixteen after his mother died and shaping him both physically and mentally after Tyson had spent years living in fear and poverty. In <i>Iron Ambition</i>, Tyson elaborates on the life lessons that D&#x2019;Amato passed down to him, and reflects on how the trainer&#x2019;s words of wisdom continue to resonate with him outside the ring.

The tale of their forbidden relationship and its tragic consequences makes it clear Dorrie and Isabelle are headed for a gathering of the utmost importance and that the history of Isabelle's first and greatest love just might help Dorrie find her own way.</p></p><p>JULIE KIBLER began writing <i>Calling Me Home</i> after learning a bit of family lore: as a young woman, her grandmother fell in love with a young black man in an era and locale that made the relationship impossible. When not writing, she enjoys travel, independent films, music, photography, and corralling her teenagers and rescue dogs. She lives in Arlington, Texas. <i>Calling Me Home </i>is her debut.<i>1</i> <br>&nbsp; <br> <i>Miss Isabelle, Present Day</i> <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>I ACTED HATEFUL to Dorrie the first time we met, a decade or so ago. A person gets up in years and she forgets to use her filters. Or she&#x2019;s beyond caring. Dorrie thought I didn&#x2019;t care for the color of her skin. No truth to that at all. Yes, I was angry, but only because my beauty operator&#x2014;hairdresser they call them these days, or <i>stylist,</i> which sounds so uppity&#x2014;left with no notice. I walked all the way into the shop, which is no small effort when you&#x2019;re old, and the girl at the counter told me my regular girl had quit. While I stood there blinking my eyes, fit to be tied, she studied the appointment book. With a funny smile, she said, &#x201c;Dorrie has an opening. She could do you almost right away.&#x201d; <br>Presently, Dorrie called me over, and certainly, her looks surprised me&#x2014;she was the only African-American in the place, as far as I could tell. But here was the real problem: change. I didn&#x2019;t like it. People who didn&#x2019;t know how I liked my hair. People who made the cape too tight around my neck. People who went away without any warning. I needed a minute, and I guess it showed. Even at eighty, I liked my routine, and the older I get, the more it matters. Picture me now at almost ninety. &nbsp; Ninety. I&#x2019;m old enough to be Dorrie&#x2019;s white-haired grandmother. And then some. That much is obvious. But Dorrie? She probably doesn&#x2019;t even know she&#x2019;s become like the daughter I never had. For the longest time, I followed her from salon to salon&#x2014;when she wouldn&#x2019;t settle down and stay put. She&#x2019;s happier now, has her own shop these days, but she comes to me. Like a daughter would. <br>We always talk when Dorrie comes. At first, when I met her, it was just the regular stuff. The weather. News stories. My soap operas and game shows, her reality TV and sitcoms. Anything to pass the time while she washed and styled my hair. But over time, when you see the same person week after week, year after year, for an hour or more, things can go a bit deeper. Dorrie started talking about her kids, her crazy ex-husband, and how she hoped to open her own shop one day, then all the work that entailed. I&#x2019;m a good listener. <br>Sometimes, she&#x2019;d ask me about things, too. Once she started coming to my house, and we got comfortable in our routine, she asked about the pictures on my walls, the keepsakes I have on display here and there. Those were easy enough to tell about. <br>It&#x2019;s funny how sometimes you find a friend&#x2014;in the likely places&#x2014;and almost immediately, you can talk about anything. But more often than not, after the initial blush, you find you really have nothing in common. With others, you believe you&#x2019;ll never be more than acquaintances. You&#x2019;re so different, after all. But then this thing surprises you, sticking longer than you ever predicted, and you begin to rely on it, and that relationship whittles down your walls, little by little, until you realize you know that one person better than almost anyone. You&#x2019;re really and truly friends. <br>It&#x2019;s like that with Dorrie and me. Who would have thought ten years later we&#x2019;d still be doing business together, but so much more, as well. That we&#x2019;d not only be talking about our shows but sometimes watching them together. That she&#x2019;d be making excuses to stop by several days a week, asking if I need her to run any errands for me&#x2014;wanting to know if I&#x2019;m out of milk or eggs, if I need to go to the bank. That I&#x2019;d be making sure when I ride the cart around the grocery store, after the Handitran drops me off, I put a six-pack of her favorite soft drink in the basket so she&#x2019;ll have something to wet her whistle before she starts on my hair. <br>One time, a few years back, she looked embarrassed when she started to ask me a question. She stopped mid-sentence. <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Cat got your tongue? That&#x2019;s a first.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &#x201c;Oh, Miss Isabelle, I know you wouldn&#x2019;t be interested. Never mind.&#x201d; &nbsp; &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said. I was never one to pick something out of people that they didn&#x2019;t want to tell. &nbsp; &#x201c;Well, since you begged me&#x2026;&#x201d; She grinned. &#x201c;Stevie&#x2019;s got this concert at school Thursday night. He&#x2019;s got a solo&#x2014;on the trumpet. You know he plays the trumpet?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How could I miss it, Dorrie? You&#x2019;ve been telling me about it for three years, since he auditioned.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &#x201c;I know, Miss Isabelle. I&#x2019;m kind of over-the-top proud when it comes to the kids. Anyway, would you like to come with me? To see him play?&#x201d; &nbsp; I thought about it for a minute. Not because there was any question whether I wanted to go, but because I was a little overcome. It took too long for me to find my voice. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, Miss Isabelle. Don&#x2019;t feel like you have to. My feelings won&#x2019;t be hurt and&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &nbsp; &#x201c;No! I&#x2019;d love to. In fact, I can&#x2019;t think of anything I&#x2019;d rather do Thursday.&#x201d; &nbsp; She laughed. It&#x2019;s not like I ever went anywhere, and Thursday was a boring night for television that year. <br> Since then, it hasn&#x2019;t been uncommon for her to take me along when the kids have special events. Heaven knows, their father usually forgets to show up. Dorrie&#x2019;s mother usually comes, too, and we have nice little chats, but I always wonder what she thinks about my being there. She studies me with a shade of curiosity, as though she can&#x2019;t fathom any reason for Dorrie and me to be friends. &nbsp; But there&#x2019;s still so much Dorrie doesn&#x2019;t know. Things nobody knows. If I were going to tell anyone, it would likely be her. It would definitely be her. And I think it&#x2019;s time. More than anyone, I trust her not to judge me, not to question the way things happened and the way things turned out. &nbsp; So here I am, asking her to drive me all the way from Texas to Cincinnati, halfway across the country, to help me tend to things. I&#x2019;m not too proud to admit I can&#x2019;t do this alone. I&#x2019;ve done plenty for myself, by myself, as long as I can remember. <br>But this? No. This I can&#x2019;t do alone. And I don&#x2019;t want to anyway. I want my daughter; I want Dorrie. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Julie Kibler <br></p><h2>Kin</h2><p>A new novel by the Bram Stoker Award-winning author of THE TURTLE BOY. <br> <br> On a scorching hot summer day in Elkwood, Alabama, Claire Lambert staggers naked, wounded, and half-blind away from the scene of an atrocity. She is the sole survivor of a nightmare that claimed her friends, and even as she prays for rescue, the killers -- a family of cannibalistic lunatics -- are closing in. <br> <br> A soldier suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder returns from Iraq to the news that his brother is among the murdered in Elkwood. <br> <br> In snowbound Detroit, a waitress trapped in an abusive relationship gets an unexpected visit that will lead to bloodshed and send her back on the road to a past she has spent years trying to outrun. <br> <br> And Claire, the only survivor of the Elkwood Massacre, haunted by her dead friends, dreams of vengeance... a dream which will be realized as grief and rage turn good people into cold-blooded murderers and force alliances among strangers. <br> <br> It's time to return to Elkwood. <br> <br> In the spirit of such iconic horror classics as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Deliverance, Kin begins at the end and studies the possible aftermath for the survivors of such traumas upon their return to the real world -- the guilt, the grief, the thirst for revenge -- and sets them on an unthinkable journey... back into the heart of darkness. <br> <br></p><p><b>Excerpt from KIN:</b><br><br> -1-<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Elkwood, Alabama</i><br> <i>July 15th, 2004</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Everything is dead</i>.<br><br>Naked, bloodied and stunned, the sun high in the cloudless sky and scalding her sweat-slicked skin, Claire Lambert nevertheless managed to note that the stunted, bone-white tree in the field to her right was the same one she'd commented on a few days, months, or years earlier, though what she might have said about it was a mystery now. She stopped walking--if indeed she'd been walking at all, for the sensation thus far was one of being still, spine bent, the road moving like a granite-studded conveyor belt beneath her torn and filthy feet--and squinted at the gnarled trunk, which looked like an emaciated mother with an elaborate wind-wracked headdress, twisted limbs curled protectively around its womb, knees bent, feet splayed and poking out from beneath the hem of a skirt that had been washed and worn a few times too often.<br><br>It fascinated Claire, and though she swayed as if she might fall on legs that had many miles ago ceased registering as anything but independent creatures burdened with her weight, she couldn't look away. Fire licked with cold tongues at her groin; the blood in her hair hardened, and whatever vile substance now lay in a gelid, solidifying lump in the hole which had once contained her right eye, ticked as if someone had replaced it with a watch to measure the time she had left. But still she looked, still she stared, as the merciless sun turned her scalp pink and cooked the flesh on her back. Sweat, cooler in the scant shade beneath her breasts, fell like tears. At length, she twitched, and her legs shuffled her toward the barbed wire fence that separated the field from the road. Cotton whispered in the breeze as her stomach met the wire, the barbs pressing deep into the skin; she felt nothing but an involuntary shiver. <br><br>A startled bird exploded from the cotton with a cry that dragged her attention to its whickering form as it soared high, then lost itself in the blinding blanket of the sun. Claire lowered her head, licked dry, cracked lips with a sandpaper tongue and pushed again against the fence, unable to understand why her progress was being halted. Surely no one would begrudge her a conference with that tree, a taste of the maternal comfort she felt it might offer. Again she pushed, and again she was withheld. This time the barbs pierced her skin. Troubled, she took a half-step back, the black wire thrumming like a guitar string strummed by the breeze. A single drop of her blood welled from the iron tip of a barb and hung, suspended in time, refusing the sun, before it plummeted and colored crimson a finger of grass. Frowning, she looked slowly from the wire to the tree, as if the blame might lay with that withered woman, and tried to speak, to beg. A thin whistle was all that emerged from her parched throat--<i>Help me</i>--and she swallowed what felt like a handful of hot stones.<br><br>A sound.<br><br>She turned, reluctant to look away from the tree, but drawn by the only other noise she had heard thus far not immediately attributable to nature, or that soft voice inside her chanting incessantly and with tireless determination that everything was dead. A strand of her hair snagged on her lower lip, and stayed there, held in a fissure where the skin had split.<br><br>Raging white light thundered toward her. Of this she was only dimly aware, for between that light and where she stood swaying, was a man with no face or hands. No, that wasn't quite right. Daniel still had his hands, but they no longer had skin and looked impossibly dark and raw. This didn't concern her, for rarely had he held her anyway--a lapse in affection of which she had once upon a time hoped to disabuse him.<i><br><br>Why won't you hold my hand?</i><i><br><br>Because we're not kids anymore, babe.</i><br><br>But at the sight of that flayed skull, a tear, like the blood on the wire, defied the sun and spilled from her one good eye.<br><br>"We can hitch a ride," he told her, though his lips never moved. The raw ragged open wound of his face, topped by a nest of unruly brown hair, turned to nod at the glaring light behind him, which had grown closer still. The mirrored sun floated above shimmering metal, the wheels grinding up thick mustard-colored clouds.<br><br>She opened her mouth to respond, to tell her boyfriend that they really should wait for the others, but even had she possessed the voice to convey the words, a sudden bolt of dazzling pain tried to scissor her in half, forcing her to double over as she vomited into the dirt at her feet.<i><br><br>Everything is dead</i>.<br><br>Her head swelled as she watched a dark red river flow from her mouth, turning dust to rust and spattering her ankles. The veins in her neck stuck out in thick cords, her ruined eye began to burn and throb, making it feel as if her brain was trying to force its way out of her, to distance itself farther from this confusing reality than she had thus far managed on her own.<br><br>Weakened, she dropped to her knees, felt the ground abrade the skin there. But there was no pain. Her flesh had become a thick heavy coat, and the many tears in the lining affected her not at all. Her palms slid into the dirt.<br><br>The sound of squealing might have been of old hinges in the doors of the earth opening to accept her; it might have been her own struggle to breathe against a torrent of vile regurgitated panic and grief, or it might have been the brakes on the car she'd seen coming because now a new voice, a strange voice, drifted down to her sunburned ears as a figure eclipsed the sun and a cool shadow was thrown like a blanket over her bare back.<br><br>"Jesus, Mary'n Joseph'n all the holy saints," it said. "What happened, Miss?"<i><br><br>It's them</i>, she thought feebly. <i>One of them come to take me back. To hurt me again. </i>It was the same knowledge that had kept her going this far, the unmistakable feeling of being watched, stalked, hunted, meant to die but breathing still.<br><br>She shook her head to deny him. Opened her mouth to speak but only blood emerged, the river of sickness forcing her throat to swell. Still she tried to struggle, but when she raised her hands to protect herself, it happened only in her mind. Her limbs would not respond. The pair of dusty boots that had pressed into her field of vision moved away.<i><br><br>Good. Go. Leave me alone. You've done enough. Everything is dead. You killed them all.</i><br><br>"Christ, Pete, get me that 'ol dog blanket an' the flask. Move!"<br><br>At last the dizzying current ceased and she found strength enough to raise her head. The man was a wiry knot of shadow under a crooked hat, a scarecrow with a golden halo, trying to deceive her into thinking him salvation. Dread pounded at her chest, igniting further knots of pain that seemed to radiate from the core of her.<br><br>Another shadow sprouted from the man's shoulder, this one just as thin, but without a hat, just a fuzz of hair.<i><br><br>They're here to kill me</i>.<br><br>"Oh God, lookit her eye."<br><br>"Shut your fool mouth, boy."<br><br>"What happ'ned to her? She ain't got no clothes on." The voice was filled with nervous excitement.<br><br>The hatless shadow was elbowed aside. The thin one flapped its arms until its chest became wings descending around Claire, swaddling her.<br><br>"Help me carry her."<br><br>She opened her mouth to moan at the sudden, terrible heat enveloping her and felt new warmth seep from between her legs. The dirt turned dark quickly.<br><br>"Pa she done wet hers--"<br><br>"<i>Now</i>."<br><br>Before the arms could press their wings even tighter around her, Claire took a series of quick, dry, painful swallows, then drew in a breath that sounded like nails on a blackboard, and screamed for Daniel. But even as that tortured, awful noise poured out of her, and though she was surrounded by shadows that were lifting her up and carrying her back to Hell, she knew for the first time in her life that she was well and truly alone, and that no help was coming now, or ever.<br>* * *Born and raised in Dungarvan, Ireland, Kealan Patrick Burke is the Bram Stoker Award-winning author of five novels (Master of the Moors, Currency of Souls, Kin, The Living, and Nemesis: The Death of Timmy Quinn), over a hundred short stories, three collections (Ravenous Ghosts, The Number 121 to Pennsylvania &amp; Others, and Theater Macabre), and editor of four acclaimed anthologies (Taverns of the Dead, Quietly Now: A Tribute to Charles L.

After graduating from Michigan State University with a journalism degree, Jim was soon headed to Juneau, Alaska. As the outdoors and sports editor of the Juneau Empire, Jim became the first Alaskan sportswriter to win a national award from Associated Press. More significant than the writing award, Jim discovered his passion for the mountains and wilderness travel while living in Alaska's capital city. In 1981, Jim spent a winter in New Zealand to backpack and write his first book, Tramping in New Zealand for Lonely Planet. Six editions and almost 30 years later Tramping in New Zealand is the world's bestselling guidebook to backpacking in that country. Jim followed up with the first edition of Lonely Planet's Alaska and later Hiking in Alaska and then returned to Michigan to write Isle Royale National Park: Foot Trails &amp; Water Routes. The guide to the wilderness areas of Isle Royale has been in publication in various editions for more than 25 years and today is known as the "backpacker's bible" to the Lake Superior island. Today DuFresne lives in Michigan where he's never more than an hour's drive from the shoreline of the Great Lakes. He is the main contributor to www.MichiganTrailMaps.com, a resource web site devoted to trail users and the promotion of trails in his home state. He still heads back to Alaska frequently to update his Lonely Planet guidebooks, only now he doesn't have to live there in the winter. In Michigan DuFresne can be found out on the trail, whether it is hiking, mountain biking, backpacking, snowshoeing or cross-country skiing as the author to more than 20 guidebooks.</p><h2>The Five Rings: Miyamoto Musashi&#39;s Art of Strategy</h2><p><p>Written by the legendary swordsman Musashi Miyamoto, <i>The Five Rings</i> (c.1645) is more than just a manual on sword-fighting techniques: its Zen philosophy offers tactics and strategies as relevant to personal success today as they were to 17th-century samurai. <i>The Five Rings</i> speaks to every age about the essential roles of harmony and self-mastery in our lives. Of the many translations of <i>The Five Rings</i>, David K. Groff's translation background as a long-time resident of Japan, native-level fluency of Japanese, and an accomplished martial arts study means that he is uniquely suited for translating Musashi Miamoto's message. This message offers an engaging teaching to those who are involved with martial arts, military strategy, corporate hierarchy, and all who seek a model for personal development in a straight-forward and unpretentious way.</p><p>In addition to <i>The Five Rings</i>, this beautiful volume includes two additional short texts by Miyamoto: <i>Thirty-Five Articles on Strategy</i> and <i>The Path Walked Alone</i>.</p></p><p><p>Very little remains of<b> Miamoto Musashi</b> except <i>Five Rings</i> and a few letters he exchanged, but it's enough to keep his legacy alive.</p><p></p><p><b>David K.

A skilled reinforcer rather than a strict enforcer?<br><br>Over the past two decades, countless dog trainers across the world have embraced the liberal use of positive reinforcement. Often accompanying this trend, however, is an underlying emphasis, inherited from more coercive models of dog training, that each human in the family must be the dog's leader. But adopting the role of leader using what is known as the "Nothing in Life is Free" training protocol can result in stifling rules that constrain a person's ability to share affection and attention with their dogs. This focus on human leadership puts puts the burden on dogs to "earn" their rewards rather than placing the primary responsibility on the humans to be generous, precise, creative "feeders" (i.e., reinforcers).<br><br>In this new book, renowned dog trainer Kathy Sdao reveals how her journey through life and her decades of experience training marine mammals and dogs led her to reject a number of sacred cows including the leadership model of dog training. She describes in narrative fashion how she has come to focus her own training philosophy which emphasizes developing partnerships in which humans and dogs exchange reinforcements and continually cede the upper hand to one another.<br><br>What animal behavior experts are saying about Plenty in Life is Free:<br>This extraordinary book fills the gap between contemporary training technology and ethics.

Kennedy</h2><p>In June 1938, Future British Prime Minister Winston Churchill published a book entitled &#x201c;Arms and the Covenant&#x201d;. It was then published in the US in September 1938 as &#x201c;While England Slept; a Survey of World Affairs, 1932-1938&#x201d;. It highlighted the United Kingdom's lack of military preparation. At that time the war was looming but had not started yet. The majority in England wanted to stay out of the war and to rely in England's natural barriers. However, the views of Churchill ultimately prevailed and it was largely on the strength on this book that Churchill was elected Prime Minister. In 1940, future President John F. Kennedy, then a student in his senior year at Harvard University, found he did not agree with the analysis by Churchill of the reasons for the war, so he wrote a book with almost the same title. Kennedy wrote this essentially as a critique and a rebuttal. In it, he in he examined the reasons for the UK's lack of preparation. Why England Slept by John F. Kennedy was first published in 1940 and went through at least five reprintings. It has become a rare book, virtually impossible to get, because of the fame of the author, until this reprinting by Ishi Press.</p><p>John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917 in Brookline, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard with honors in 1940 and served as a P.T Boat Commander in the South Pacific during World War II. He was decorated twice by the Navy for the serious injuries he suffered when his boat was rammed in two while attacking a Japanese destroyer in the Solomons, and for &#34;his courage, endurance and excellent leadership&#34; in towing injured members of his crew to safety. A writer and newspaperman, Senator Kennedy in 1940 wrote Why England Slept, a best-selling analysis of England&#39;s unpreparedness for war, termed by the New York Times &#34;a notable textbook for our times.&#34; Kennedy was elected to Congress in 1946 at the age of twenty-nine, and re-elected in 1948 and 1950. In 1952 he became the third Democrat ever elected to the Senate from Massachusetts, receiving the largest vote ever polled by a Senator in the history of the State. In the 1952 U.S. Senate election, Kennedy defeated incumbent Republican Henry Cabot Lodge II for the U.S. Senate seat. The following year, he married Jacqueline Bouvier. Kennedy underwent several spinal operations over the next two years. Often absent from the Senate, he was at times critically ill and received Catholic last rites. During his convalescence in 1956, he published Profiles in Courage, a book about U.S. Senators who risked their careers for their personal beliefs, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1957. He was elected President of the United States John F. Kennedy was sworn in on January 20, 1961. In his inaugural address he spoke of the need for all Americans to be active citizens, famously saying, &#34;Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.&#34; He asked the nations of the world to join together to fight what he called the &#34;common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself&#34;. President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, at 12:30 pm Central Standard Time on Friday November 22, 1963, while on a political trip to Texas to smooth over frictions in the Democratic Party between liberals and conservative John Connally. Traveling in a presidential motorcade through downtown Dallas, he was shot once in the throat and once in the head. Kennedy was taken to Parkland Hospital, but pronounced dead at 1:00 pm. Only 46, President Kennedy died younger than any other U.S. president. There are numerous theories as to who killed him and why, but none have been proven.</p><h2>In the Bleak Midwinter (Clare Fergusson/Russ Van Alstyne Mysteries)</h2><p><p>It's a cold, snowy December in the upstate New York town of Millers Kill, and newly ordained Clare Fergusson is on thin ice as the first female priest of its small Episcopal church. The ancient regime running the parish covertly demands that she prove herself as a leader. However, her blunt manner, honed by years as an army pilot, is meeting with a chilly reception from some members of her congregation and Chief of Police Russ Van Alystyne, in particular, doesn't know what to make of her, or how to address "a lady priest" for that matter. </p><p>The last thing she needs is trouble, but that is exactly what she finds. When a newborn baby is abandoned on the church stairs and a young mother is brutally murdered, Clare has to pick her way through the secrets and silence that shadow that town like the ever-present Adirondack mountains. As the days dwindle down and the attraction between the avowed priest and the married police chief grows, Clare will need all her faith, tenacity, and courage to stand fast against a killer's icy heart. </p><p><i>In the Bleak Midwinter</i> is one of the most outstanding Malice Domestic winners the contest has seen.

She is not just a "lady," she's a tough ex Army chopper pilot, and nobody's fool. Then a newborn infant left at the church door brings her together with the town's police chief, Russ Van Alstyne, who's also ex-Army and a cynical good shepherd for the stray sheep of his hometown. Their search for the baby's mother quickly leads them into the secrets that shadow Miller's Kill like the ever-present Adirondacks. What they discover is a world of trouble, an attraction to each other-and murder... <br>"Superb!"<br>-"Library Journal <br>"Terrific action scenes...what really distinguishes" In the Bleak Midwinter, however, is the author's skillful portrayal of her protagonist's inner conflict."<br>"-Washington Post Book World <br>"A riveting page-turner from start to finish."<br>-"Publishers Weekly (starred review) <br>Bestselling author <b>Julia Spencer-Fleming</b> is the winner of the Agatha, Anthony, Macavity, Dilys, Barry, Nero Wolfe, and Gumshoe Awards, and an Edgar and <i>Romantic Times</i> RC Award finalist.

Yunus conceived of a new form of banking -- microcredit -- that would offer very small loans to the poorest people without collateral, and teach them how to manage and use their loans to create successful small businesses. He founded Grameen Bank based on the belief that credit is a basic human right, not the privilege of a fortunate few, and it now provides $24 billion of micro-loans to more than nine million families. Ninety-seven percent of its clients are women, and repayment rates are over 90 percent. Outside of Bangladesh, micro-lending programs inspired by Grameen have blossomed, and serve hundreds of millions of people around the world. <br>The definitive history of micro-credit direct from the man that conceived of it, Banker to the Poor is the moving story of someone who dreamed of changing the world -- and did.</p><p><b>Muhammad Yunus </b>was born in Bangladesh and earned his Ph.D. in economics in the United States at Vanderbilt University, where he was deeply influenced by the civil rights movement. He is the author of Creating a World Without Poverty, Building Social Business, and A World of Three Zeros. The recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, the Congressional Gold Medal, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, he still lives in Bangladesh, and travels widely around the world on behalf of Grameen and the concept of micro-credit."By giving poor people the power to help themselves, Dr. Yunus has offered them something far more valuable than a plate of food - security in its most fundamental form."&#x2015;<b><i>President Jimmy Carter</i></b><br><br>"[Yunus's] ideas have already had a great impact on the Third World, and ... hearing his appeal for a 'poverty-free world' from the source itself can be as stirring as that all-American myth of bootstrap success."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Washington Post</i></i></b><br><br>"I only wish every nation shared Dr. Yunus's and the Grameen Bank's appreciation of the vital role that women play in the economic, social, and political life of our societies."&#x2015;<b><i>Hillary Clinton</i></b><br><br>"Muhammad Yunus is a practical visionary who has improved the lives of millions of people in his native Bangladesh and elsewhere in the world.

Strelecky, an M.B.A. and inspirational speaker, gives some of these questions a fresh turn and brings the reader on a quick journey into self-exploration. Through a fictional account, he tells the story of John, who sets out on a vacation to escape from his unfulfilling life. But after a forced detour, he finds himself lost and his car very low on gas as darkness falls. Beginning to despair, John sees the lights of the Why Caf� in the near distance and heads in that direction. Despite its appearance, this isn't your typical cafe; it's one where the menu poses questions like "Why are you here?" Before long, John is facing up to what he needs to do to find his way to the life he really wants. This is a simple read but asks profound questions about the purpose of life and our role as individuals. While it often seems that John is overly obtuse, his questioning helps to draw the story out and offers a richer picture of the options available to anyone looking for more meaning in life. <i>(June 1)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Susan Kaiser Greenland has had a lot of success bringing mindfulness to the classroom, and in this book she shares her experience, showing how parents, caregivers, and teachers can cultivate these qualities at home or in a school setting. She includes fifty mindfulness games that develop what Greenland calls the "new A, B, C's" for learning and for a happy and successful life: Attention, Balance, and Compassion. In a playful way, the games introduce kids to breathing practices and techniques for developing focus, concentration, and sensory awareness, and identifying and self-regulating emotions, among others skills. They include "anchor" games that develop concentration; visualization games that encourage kindness and focus; analytical games that cultivate clear thinking; and awareness games that develop all of these qualities and give greater insight into ourselves, others, and relationships. Greenland contextualizes each game and offers guidance for the parents/caregivers throughout.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the games are written for kids, they can be just as fun and transformative for adults. Greenland encourages parents and caregivers to develop their own attention, balance, and compassion and explore the universal concepts that she presents. She points out that as caregivers, our own mindfulness has a powerful effect on everyone in our lives, especially our children. They notice when we're calmer, more composed, and more joyful, and learn by our example.</p><p>SUSAN KAISER GREENLAND developed the Inner Kids mindful awareness program, and teaches secular mindful awareness practices to children, parents, and professionals around the world.

In this amazingly comprehensible history of the universe, <b>Simon Singh</b> decodes the mystery behind the Big Bang theory, lading us through the development of one of the most extraordinary, important, and awe-inspiring theories in science.</p></p><p>A baffling array of science books claim to reveal how the mysteries of the universe have been discovered, but Simon Singh's <i>Big Bang</i> actually delivers on that promise. General readers will find it to be among the very best books dealing with cosmology, because Singh follows the same plan he used in his brilliant <i>Code Book</i>: he puts people--not equations--first in the story. By linking the progression of the Big Bang theory with the scientists who built it up bit by bit, Singh also uncovers an important truth about how such ideas grow. <blockquote> Death is an essential element in the progress of science, since it takes care of conservative scientists of a previous generation reluctant to let go of an old, fallacious theory and embrace a new and accurate one. </blockquote> As harsh as this statement seems, even Einstein defended an outmoded idea about the universe when an unknown interloper published equations challenging the great man. Einstein didn't have to die for cosmology to move forward (he reluctantly apologized for being wrong), but stories like this one show how difficult it can sometimes be for new theories to take root. Fred Hoyle, who coined the term "big bang" as a way to ridicule the idea of a universe expanding from some tiny origin point, strongly believed that the cosmos was in a steady state. But Singh shows how Hoyle's research, meant to prove the contrary, added evidence to the expansion model. <i>Big Bang</i> is also a history of astronomical observation, describing the development of new telescopes that were crucial to the development of cosmology. Handwritten summary notes at the end of each long chapter add a charming, classroom feel to this revealing and very readable book. <i>--Therese Littleton</i><p>Simon Singh received his Ph.D. in particle physics from the University of Cambridge.

Hopkins (1866&#x2013;1932) was one of the great advertising pioneers. He believed advertising existed only to sell something and should be measurable and justify the results that it produced. He worked for various advertisers, including Bissell Carpet Sweeper Company, Swift &amp; Company and Dr. Shoop's patent medicine company. At the age of 41, he was hired by Albert Lasker owner of Lord &amp; Thomas advertising in 1907 at a salary of $185,000 a year, Hopkins insisted copywriters researched their client products and produce "reason-why" copy. He believed that a good product was often its own best salesperson, and as such he was a great believer in sampling. To track the results of his advertising, he used key coded coupons and then tested headlines, offers and propositions against one another. He used the analysis of these measurements to continually improve his ad results, driving responses and the cost effectiveness of his clients advertising spend. His classic book, "Scientific Advertising," was published in 1923, following his retirement from Lord &amp; Thomas, where he finished his career as president and chairman. He died in 1932. Charles Duhigg credits Hopkins with popularizing tooth brushing, as a result of Hopkins' campaigns for Pepsodent.</p><h2>Leo: A Ghost Story</h2><p><b>A <em>New York Times</em> Best Illustrated Book of 2015</b><br>You would like being friends with Leo. He likes to draw, he makes delicious snacks, and most people can't even see him. Because Leo is also a ghost. When a new family moves into his home and Leo's efforts to welcome them are misunderstood, Leo decides it is time to leave and see the world. That is how he meets Jane, a kid with a tremendous imagination and an open position for a worthy knight. That is how Leo and Jane become friends. And that is when their adventures begin. This charming tale of friendship&#x2014;from two of the best young minds in picture books: the author of the Caldecott Honor&#x2013;winning <em>Extra Yarn</em> and the illustrator of the Bologna Ragazzi Award&#x2013;winning <em>Josephine</em>&#x2014;is destined to become a modern classic that will delight readers for years to come.</p><p>Mac Barnett is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of many picture books, including <em>Telephone</em> and <em>Extra Yarn</em>, which won a Caldecott Honor, the Boston Globe&#x2013;Horn Book Award, and the E.B. White ReadAloud Award. Mac lives in Berkeley, California.<br><br>Christian Robinson has illustrated several acclaimed picture books, including <em>Josephine: The Dazzling Life of Josephine Baker</em>, which received the Coretta Scott King Honor, a Robert F. Sibert Honor, a Bologna Ragazzi Honor Award for nonfiction, and a Boston Globe&#x2013;Horn Book Honor. He lives in San Francisco, California.K-Gr 2&#x2014;When Leo, a ghost, finds the new inhabitants of his house unwelcoming, he takes to the streets. Luckily, he encounters the fantastically fun Jane, who believes he is an imaginary friend. When Leo helps catch a thief breaking into her house, he is forced to admit that he is not an imaginary friend but a real one. Fortunately, the unflappable Jane graciously takes this all in stride. Barnett's story is expectedly droll and told in deadpan prose. There's just enough of it to provide a canvas for Robinson's thoughtful illustrations. His palette is almost exclusively blue, but the contrast between the different tones is sharp, and the heavy doses of gray with hints of green soften much of the blue into a neutral tone. Robinson solves the issue of a white ghost on a white page smartly by depicting Leo as a blue outline on white paper. Leo beautifully contrasts with the geometrically composed live humans, and Robinson finds some clever opportunities for depicting Leo's transparency. The balance of texture and white space helps mitigate the many shades of blue, retaining visual interest and keeping the overall feel upbeat. VERDICT A whimsical tale from Barnett aptly accompanied by enthralling artwork by Robinson.

It's a different way to program---unit tests are written in a tight feedback loop with the production code, assuring your code does what you think. You get valuable feedback every few minutes. You find mistakes before they become bugs. You get early warning of design problems. You get immediate notification of side effect defects. You get to spend more time adding valuable features to your product.<br><br>James is one of the few experts in applying TDD to embedded C. With his 1.5 decades of training,coaching, and practicing TDD in C, C++, Java, and C# he will lead you from being a novice in TDD to using the techniques that few have mastered.<br><br>This book is full of code written for embedded C programmers. You don't just see the end product, you see code and tests evolve. James leads you through the thought process and decisions made each step of the way. You'll learn techniques for test-driving code right nextto the hardware, and you'll learn design principles and how to apply them to C to keep your code clean and flexible.<br><br>To run the examples in this book, you will need a C/C++ development environment on your machine, and the GNU GCC tool chain or Microsoft Visual Studio for C++ (some project conversion may be needed).</p></p><p><p>James Grenning trains, coaches, and consults worldwide. His considerable experience brings depth in both technical and business aspects of software development. James is leading the way to introduce Agile development practices to the embedded world. He invented Planning Poker and is one of the original authors of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, February 2001.</p><p>""This book is targeting the embedded-programmer-on-the-street and hits its target. It is neither spoon-fed baby talk nor useless theory-spin. In clear and simple prose, James shows working geeks each of the TDD concepts and their C implementations. Any C programmer can benefit from working through this book."" --Michael "GeePaw" Hill, Senior TDD coach, Anarchy Creek Software </p><p>""I have been preaching and teaching TDD in C for years, and finally there is a book I can recommend to fellow C programmers who want to learn more about modern programming techniques."" --Olve Maudal, C programmer, Cisco Systems<br></p><p>""James is a true pioneer in applying Agile development techniques to embedded product development...this book was worth waiting for. This is a good and useful book that every embedded developer should read.""--Bas Vodde, Author of "Scaling Lean and Agile Development" and "Practices for Scaling Lean and Agile Development," Odd-e, Singapore</p></p><h2>The Christmas Magic</h2><p><b>Best-selling author, Lauren Thompson, and Best-selling Caldecott Honor Book artist Jon J Muth join forces to present a story that is filled with the magic, wonder, and love of Christmas.</b><br><br>Far, far North, when the nights are longest and the stars shine brightest, Santa begins to prepare for his big night of giving. He gathers his reindeer, feeds them parsnips and berries, and polishes his bells and his sled. Then lovingly, he chooses toys for every child in the world. For Santa loves them all, and he knows what each child at heart wants most. Then, with the thrum of magic that makes reindeers fly, he spreads the Christmas joy and warmth throughout the world--as he always has -- and always will until the end of time.</p><p>Lauren Thompson is the author of many beloved picture books, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Polar Bear Night</i>, its companion <i>Polar Bear Morning</i>, and <i>The Christmas Magic</i>. She is also the author of the popular Little Quack and Mouse's First series. She lives in Brooklyn, New York, with her husband and their son. Visit her online at laurenthompson.net.<br>Jon J Muth, renowned in the world of graphic novels, won an Eisner Award for his paintings in the graphic novel, <i>The Mystery Play</i> by Grant Morrison. He&#x2019;s partnered with Neil Gaiman on <i>The Sandman: The Wake</i>, Walter and Louise Simonson on <i>Havoc &amp; Wolverine: Meltdown</i>, and J. M. DeMatteis on <i>Moonshadow</i> and <i>Silver Surfer</i>. <br>His enchanting picture books include his Caldecott Honor Book <i>Zen Shorts</i> and four companion books featuring Stillwater the Panda. His book <i>The Three Questions</i>, based on a short story by Tolstoy, was called "quietly life-changing" by the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>. And the <i>Horn Book</i> called Jon's <i>Stone Soup</i> "delicious and satisfying." His exquisitely beautiful books have been translated into more than 15 languages and are cherished by readers of all ages. Jon lives in New York State with his wife and their four children.<br>Children get a different Santa than they are used to in a book that focuses on the quiet preparation that leads to Christmas. Far, far north, this Santa Claus is not a jolly old elf, but rather a thin, subdued fellow in a blue suit. There&#x2019;s no Mrs. Claus&#x2014;well, Santa darns his own socks&#x2014;nor are there busy elves. Just reindeer called home from a snowy wilderness who are fed parsnips and berries before their long journey. Alone, Santa readies his sleigh and visits a room with toys, where he picks one for each boy and girl in his book. Finally the night &#x201c;thrums with magic,&#x201d; and Santa embarks on his vast journey. It&#x2019;s the air of magic and mystery, which prevails in both text and art, that will capture children&#x2019;s interest and allow them to accept a Santa who is not the norm. This is primarily true in the majestic outdoor spreads that are all stars and snow and sing of unknown possibilities. But even the cozy indoor scenes have a slightly unsettling feel that will intrigue readers. A new take on an iconic figure.

HE JUST AIN&#x2019;T RIGHT<p></p> <br>Whoever you are and whatever your reasons, clearly you made the right damn decision to sit your ass down and read the most important book of your life! So, since you&#x2019;re here, let&#x2019;s begin.<br> <br>You&#x2019;re about to read a whole lot of shit in this book, and trust me, this knowledge isn&#x2019;t for all of you, but I know for a fact that some of you will get what I&#x2019;m talking about. &#x201c;Who are those people?&#x201d; you ask. If you have to ask, then it ain&#x2019;t you, because those people know who the fuck they are!!!<br> <br>Now, people have different ideas on where and how to start a story. Some people like to start in the middle by saying some shit that sounds weird because you don&#x2019;t know what the fuck came before it. The problem with that is that if you don&#x2019;t know where the fuck you&#x2019;ve been, you&#x2019;re gonna have a hard time figuring out where the hell you&#x2019;re going. Other, more creative people like to start shit toward the end, then jump to the beginning and then wrap back around to the end again. You know what I&#x2019;m talking about? It&#x2019;s what they do in every movie about a singer. Movies about people like Ray Charles, James Brown, and&#x2014;just so you don&#x2019;t think I only watch movies about black people&#x2014;Johnny Cash. All of those movies always start with a dude looking tired and old as fuck. Like we&#x2019;re catching him a day and a half before he dies. He&#x2019;s always sitting somewhere reflecting on his life as he stares at something like a clock or a glass of water or some shit. All of a sudden everything goes black for a second, and then across the screen we see the name of some tiny ass town like &#x201c;Broken Foot, Alabama,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Chipped Tooth, Tennessee,&#x201d; and a date from years ago. At this point, we know we are in a flashback, so we are treated to bits of that man&#x2019;s tragic ass life, complete with all his fuck-ups. And then, like a flash, we see him old again. That&#x2019;s what we see, but the part that we don&#x2019;t get to see is that old ass man sitting there staring at a glass of water for two hours while people tap the fuck out of him to get him to snap out of it. That&#x2019;s a movie I would like to see: the day James Brown&#x2019;s concerned friends tapped the shit out of his shoulder for two damn hours. &#x201c;James&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. James&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. James!&#x201d;<br> <br>Anyway, while I like that way of telling a story&#x2014;I mean, they did that shit in Pulp Fiction too! I loved that movie! Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta! Playing hit men! Who the fuck doesn&#x2019;t like Pulp Fiction? Besides I&#x2019;m not trying to tell you my life&#x2019;s story. I mean, I will be telling you some shit from my life, but not tragic shit and not for entertainment&#x2019;s sake. I don&#x2019;t need you judging my life. What the fuck do I look like?! Huh? What I share is for you to learn from, not to mock!<br> <br>Look, I&#x2019;ma tell you right now, I know a little about everything but not a whole lot about anything, so get from this book what you need and don&#x2019;t complain to me about shit!</p><h2>Design Your Own Coat of Arms: An Introduction to Heraldry (Dover Children&#39;s Activity Books)</h2><p>Hundreds of years ago, warriors identified themselves in battle by using certain colors and symbols on their shields.

A vice president of the legendary Explorers Club, as well as surgeon, explorer, and masterful storyteller, Dr. Kenneth Kamler has spent years discovering what happens to the human body in extreme environmental conditions. Divided into six sections&#x2014;jungle, high seas, desert, underwater, high altitude, and outer space&#x2014;this book uses firsthand testimony and documented accounts to investigate the science of what a body goes through and explains why people survive&#x2014;and why they sometimes don&#x2019;t.</p><p>Medical case studies can be fascinating to read, full of drama, heroism, and sometimes tragedy. Most doctors' tales take place in clinics or hospitals, but those pedestrian settings are not for Kenneth Kamler, who practices medicine outside, patching people up with surprising success under harrowing conditions. <i>Surviving the Extremes</i> starts with open-air surgery in the steamy jungles of the Amazon River, moves to disturbingly detailed descriptions of the many ways humans can die at sea, and from there takes white-knuckled readers through the rest of Earth's extreme environments. Krakauer fans will gasp at the book's best chapter, covering the high-altitude medical feats Kamler has performed on Mt. Everest and other peaks. "No course in medical school taught me the proper mixture of oxygen, IV fluids, and Tibetan chants to treat a subdural hematoma in below-zero temperatures on a 3-mile-high glacier," Kamler writes. Instead, he has learned the fine art of adventure doctoring by doing it, and in the process, he's won fans among the world's most prominent risk-takers. Through it all, Kamler remains fascinated by the human body's ability to heal under horrifically dangerous conditions. His medical adventures are inspiring and thrilling, as well as occasionally bloody and disgusting. In short, perfect stories of human survival. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>"Ken Kamler is a natural writer, as well as an adventurer and a prober into how much human beings can stand.

For all that we are social creatures, we are too often shoved into solitary confinement by circumstance. The color of our skin isn&#x2019;t like everyone else&#x2019;s, or our language is different, or our religion isn&#x2019;t the one that gets us invited to dinner by the neighbors. That last one has kept me alone for a long, long time. There are no more Druids walking the earth, unless you count the various neo-pagan versions, who are all operating on nineteenth-century reconstructions.<br><br>And despite the fact that I have an apprentice, I suspect she won&#x2019;t be the same sort of Druid that I am&#x2014;I mean believing in the old Irish gods as I do, paying them respect and offering them prayers, observing the holidays and the rites as the Irish used to do in the days before the invasion of the Christians. Gaia doesn&#x2019;t require belief in any deity to be bound to her: She merely requires a highly trained mind and unswerving devotion to her protection. With Granuaile I think there is a willingness to see the divine, to acknowledge and appreciate both its wonder and terror, but a stubborn resistance to worshipping it.<br><br>But she liked staring into campfires well enough. Fires were warm cups of non-thinking serenity after the daily rigors of training. I had been exhausting her mentally with languages and headspace exercises and then physically with the martial arts. By the time the sun sank behind the baked sandstone cliffs of the Navajo Nation each day, she was ready to lose herself in the yellow and orange flickers of flame. And quiz me about my past.<br><br>&#x201c;Ugh,&#x201d; she said, flopping on the ground by our fire pit and popping open a bottle of beer with a hiss and clink as the top fell to the ground. &#x201c;What a day. Wish I could just upload kung fu like Neo instead of learning it the slow way.&#x201d; She leaned back against a rock padded with a bedroll and took a swig, winced at some ache or soreness in her muscles, then said, &#x201c;Tell me about the old days, Atticus, when you were wee and had to walk both ways uphill in feces because no one had toilets.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You seriously want to hear about that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;d like to hear about some old shit, but it doesn&#x2019;t need to include actual shit, if that helps. I&#x2019;m tired, damn it. Just tell me a story.&#x201d;<br><br> Oberon said through our mental link. He was stretched out by the fire, lying across my feet, belly up for easy rubbing. Granuaile couldn&#x2019;t hear him, but she could follow along because I spoke my part of the conversation aloud.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that, Oberon?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, you mean Bast. Yes, I remember. Hard to forget something like that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You already know why she was mad. She wanted me to return the book of her cult&#x2019;s mysteries that I had stolen long ago.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, I see. Heh! Yes, I suppose that would be a good story for the night. Wow, this is going way back to the third century. I was still haunting Europe at the time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wait, Atticus, hold on,&#x201d; Granuaile said. &#x201c;Is this going to take a while?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure. Is there some hurry?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to interrupt you in the middle of it. I should answer the call of nature first.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good call, then. We&#x2019;ll reconvene after a few words from nature.&#x201d;<br><br>Some hiding places are better than others. The ones with friendly company are the best, and by friendly I mean people who don&#x2019;t particularly care about your background or what your tattoos mean. They just want a name to call you by, a sense that you&#x2019;ll pull your own weight and contribute to the group&#x2019;s survival, and maybe the occasional joke or roll in the hay. I miss the days of easy anonymity, when I could just make up a name when I got to a village and stay there as long as I could keep from using any magic that would give my position away to the Fae. I met new friends, made myself useful, and disappeared for years at a time.<br><br>That didn&#x2019;t mean I was impossible to find. The Morrigan could find me pretty much anytime she wanted. On this particular occasion, she found me hanging out with the Visigoths in what is now the southern tip of modern-day Moldova, since I was doing my best to avoid the Roman Empire. She lighted in a tree as I was collecting deadwood for the night&#x2019;s fire, and her eyes glowed red to demonstrate that she wasn&#x2019;t the average crow. I looked around. It was just me out there.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi, Morrigan. Looks like the coast is clear. You need to tell me something?&#x201d;<br><br>She flew down to the ground and shifted to her human form, the red coals in her eyes dying out. &#x201c;Hello, Siodhachan. Yes, I am here to deliver a message. Ogma needs to see you rather urgently. You must go now to meet him in Byzantium.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Byzantium? But that&#x2019;s a mess right now.&#x201d;<br><br>The Visigoths I was staying with were a part of that mess, in fact. Byzantium&#x2014;indeed, most of the Roman Empire&#x2014;was suffering what historians now call the &#x201c;Crisis of the Third Century,&#x201d; dealing with various invasions from its borders while internally their currency was taking a gigantic shit on the tiled mosaics of their bathhouse floors, and they had a string of military leaders taking turns at being emperor. The Morrigan came to see me in 269, right before Aurelian came to power and started to piece the empire back together.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to get worse, especially down in Egypt. I have seen it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Seen what, exactly?&#x201d;<br><br>The tiniest of smirks lifted one corner of the Morrigan&#x2019;s mouth. &#x201c;I have seen you in danger there. So clearly you must go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Somehow your words fail to motivate me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not supposed to motivate you to go down there. Ogma will do that. I just need you to go see him in Byzantium.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You need me to? Why? What&#x2019;s in this for you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Favors. The finest currency of them all.&#x201d;<br><br>That was less than subtle. I owed the Morrigan several favors, if not my life, and saying no to her was not an option. &#x201c;Where in Byzantium?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There is a public house called Caesar&#x2019;s Cup. Ogma will be waiting there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to take me a while.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He is aware. But you had best get started.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right. Farewell, Morrigan.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Until next time, Siodhachan.&#x201d; She shifted back to her crow form and flew off into the dusk. I hauled my wood back to the village, got the evening&#x2019;s communal fire started, then packed my few belongings and slipped into the darkness while everyone was eating their dinner.<br><br>Weeks later I strode into Caesar&#x2019;s Cup, all my tattoos hidden to disguise my Druidry, pretending to be just another Roman citizen out for a drink. Ogma was indeed there, seated at the end of a bench table, his head shaven and his tattoos concealed as well, nursing a goblet of what passed for expensive wine at the time and a board of bread and cheese.<br><br>He bobbed his head at me and gestured that I should sit down across from him.<br><br>&#x201c;No names in here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Speak Latin with me. Have a cup?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; He called for one and poured me a deep red vintage before continuing.<br><br>&#x201c;Well met. Did she tell you why I needed to see you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Something involving Aegyptus, but no more than that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. The Palmyrans will revolt soon and Rome will answer in force. The great library in Alexandria will be in danger.&#x201d;<br><br>I snorted. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s always in danger. Julius Caesar nearly burned it down a couple centuries ago.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We think this time it will be worse.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We?&#x201d;<br><br>Ogma&#x2019;s eyes shifted down the table to a couple of men who had drinks but weren&#x2019;t talking to each other. They were most likely listening to us.<br><br>&#x201c;Myself, my sister, and the crow.&#x201d; He meant Brighid and the Morrigan. &#x201c;Much knowledge will be lost forever. And some of that knowledge should be preserved. I&#x2019;m interested in a few specific scrolls.&#x201d;<br><br>Shrugging, I said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s great. Why tell me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I want you to fetch them for me.&#x201d;<br><br>I stared at him in silence for perhaps three seconds, then looked down at my drink. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand. You have all of my skills and more. Surely it must be simple for you to do it yourself?&#x201d;<br><br>Ogma chuckled and I looked up. He was grinning widely. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s far from simple. It&#x2019;s rather deadly, in fact. These scrolls are well protected.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It must be fantastic information.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is. And right now you are probably wondering why you would ever agree to do this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I admit that had crossed my mind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You will do it because there is truly wondrous information there. Anything you take beyond what I require, you are free to keep.&#x201d;<br><br>I cocked my head to one side. &#x201c;Can you give me an example of what I might be able to take that&#x2019;s worth risking my life?&#x201d;<br><br>Ogma checked on the men, and they were still making no attempt to converse. He gestured to the rear of the house. &#x201c;There is a poor excuse for a garden in back. Shall we take in some sun and continue there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br><br>We rose, cups in hand, and strolled past tables and curious eyes. Being covered from the neck down stood out in the summer, especially in a culture where bare legs below the knee were common. Ogma changed his speech to Old Irish and spoke in low tones as we moved.<br><br>&#x201c;Those men are inept but persistent. They have been following me since shortly after I arrived here. We&#x2019;ll see if they abandon all pretense and come after us or not.&#x201d;<br><br>The garden had only a couple of people in it, since it was hot outside and there was limited shade to be had; it was laid out in hedges and flower beds more than trees, and all were starving for water. The scant shelter afforded by the fronds of a lone thirsty palm was already occupied. We strolled to the far side opposite, in full sun but also far away from inquisitive ears. Ogma switched back to Latin and pitched his voice so that only I could hear, even though no one was nearby.<br><br>&#x201c;To answer your question: In the library you will find the mysteries of gods far different from the Tuatha D� Danann or others you may know. Rituals and spells and secrets long kept locked in the darkness, the kind of thing that might help you one day should Aenghus ever catch up to you. Wards that clumsy wizards can attempt only with great care and sacrifice but that you can adapt and re-craft into elegant bindings.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t sound all that great to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, it does. And besides, you are bored. You are, what, more than three hundred years old now? Living with the Visigoths for the last five?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re charming people and impressive open-air cooks. They know how to roast a rabbit on a spit, let me tell you. And they share amusing stories about their sex accidents.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pfahh. You yearn for more than this, Siodhachan. You stole Fragarach from Conn of the Hundred Battles. You absorbed the most powerful herblore of Airmid and keep it close to your heart. You cannot tell me you are satisfied to live life as a drear pastoral, that you are content with all you know and will never seek to know more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That may all be true. But that does not mean I am anxious to seek my death in Alexandria for your benefit, Ogma, begging your pardon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is for your benefit too, as I said. And if you do this for me, Siodhachan, I will owe you a favor. That is currency of far more value than any Roman coin.&#x201d;<br><br>He spoke Truth with a capital T there. When a god says he&#x2019;ll owe you a solid, unspecified, bona fide favor, you need to take time to consider whether you might not be passing up the opportunity of a lifetime. Or indeed something that might preserve your life later on: Some favors, called in at the right time, might equal a Get Out of Death Free card. Though it was clear that Ogma would not be around to get me out of any problems in Alexandria. Whatever he considered to be so deadly there would be doubly so for me.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not agreeing yet,&#x201d; I told him, &#x201c;but you have my attention at least. Tell me more. What am I after, where do I find it, and what&#x2019;s in my way?&#x201d;<br><br>Ogma smiled as victors do, drank deeply, and refilled both our cups before answering.<br><br>&#x201c;There is a sealed room of treasures beneath the library, similar to the burial chambers of pharaohs in their pyramids. Inside there are some scrolls and even a few bound books. There may be some scepters and the like, remarkable for their power more than their beauty. I want a bundle of four scrolls sealed in a lacquered box marked with the eye of Horus. You are familiar with that symbol?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. But it&#x2019;s fairly common, isn&#x2019;t it? There might be many such boxes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There are not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If the room is sealed, how do you know that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Tuatha D� Danann have their own all-seeing eyes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah. The Morrigan?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s so special about these scrolls?&#x201d;<br><br>The god of languages shrugged. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t be sure until I read them.&#x201d; A transparent evasion that meant he&#x2019;d rather not tell me.<br><br>&#x201c;Who built the room and sealed it, then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whoever built it is no doubt dead. But at least part of it is supposed to be the private hoard of the Egyptian goddess Seshat.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not familiar with her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Goddess of writing and preserving knowledge.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah. Preserving knowledge. I imagine in this case she&#x2019;s preserving it from would-be thieves.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. You may reasonably expect some curses.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Such as?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have no idea.&#x201d;<br><br>I threw up my hands. &#x201c;This chamber is underground and sealed in dead, quarried stone, right? I&#x2019;ll be cut off from Gaia and essentially powerless. I don&#x2019;t see how it can be done.&#x201d;<br><br>Ogma nodded at me, offering a small smirk. He&#x2019;d anticipated the objection. &#x201c;I have something that will help with that, at least.&#x201d;</p><h2>Echopraxia (Firefall, 2)</h2><p><p>Prepare for a different kind of singularity in Peter Watts' <i>Echopraxia, </i>the follow-up to the Hugo-nominated novel <i>Blindsight.</i> </p><p>It's the eve of the twenty-second century: a world where the dearly departed send postcards back from Heaven and evangelicals make scientific breakthroughs by speaking in tongues; where genetically engineered vampires solve problems intractable to baseline humans and soldiers come with zombie switches that shut off self-awareness during combat. And it's all under surveillance by an alien presence that refuses to show itself. </p><p>Daniel Bruks is a living fossil: a field biologist in a world where biology has turned computational, a cat's-paw used by terrorists to kill thousands. Taking refuge in the Oregon desert, he's turned his back on a humanity that shatters into strange new subspecies with every heartbeat. But he awakens one night to find himself at the center of a storm that will turn all of history inside-out. </p><p>Now he's trapped on a ship bound for the center of the solar system. To his left is a grief-stricken soldier, obsessed by whispered messages from a dead son. To his right is a pilot who hasn't yet found the man she's sworn to kill on sight. A vampire and its entourage of zombie bodyguards lurk in the shadows behind. And dead ahead, a handful of rapture-stricken monks takes them all to a meeting with something they will only call "The Angels of the Asteroids." </p><p>Their pilgrimage brings Dan Bruks, the fossil man, face-to-face with the biggest evolutionary breakpoint since the origin of thought itself.</p></p><p><p>PETER WATTS is the Hugo and Nebula nominated author of <i>Blindsight</i> and has been called "a hard science fiction writer through and through and one of the very best alive" by <i>The Globe and Mail </i>and whose work the <i>New York Times</i> called "seriously paranoid."</p><p>PRIMITIVE</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Ultimately, all science is correlation. No matter how effectively it may use one variable to describe another, its equations will always ultimately rest upon the surface of a black box. (Saint Herbert might have put it most succinctly when he observed that all proofs inevitably reduce to propositions that have no proof.) The difference between Science and Faith, therefore, is no more and no less than <i>predictive power</i>. Scientific insights have proven to be better predictors than Spiritual ones, at least in worldly matters; they prevail not because they are true, but simply because they <i>work</i>.</p> <p>The Bicameral Order represents a stark anomaly in this otherwise consistent landscape. Their explicitly faith-based methodologies venture unapologetically into metaphysical realms that defy empirical analysis&#x2014;yet they yield results with consistently more predictive power than conventional science. (How they do this is not known; our best evidence suggests some kind of rewiring of the temporal lobe in a way that amplifies their connection to the Divine.)</p> <p>It would be dangerously na�ve to regard this as a victory for traditional religion. It is not. It is a victory for a radical sect barely half a century old, and the cost of that victory has been to demolish the wall between Science and Faith. The Church&#x2019;s concession of the physical realm informed the historic armistice that has allowed faith and reason to coexist to this day. One may find it heartening to see faith ascendant once again across the Human spectrum; but it is not <i>our</i> faith. Its hand still guides lost sheep away from the soulless empiricism of secular science, but the days in which it guided them into the loving arms of Our Savior are waning.</p> <p>&#x2014;<i>An Enemy Within: The Bicameral Threat to Institutional Religion in the Twenty-First Century</i> (An Internal Report to the Holy See by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, 2093)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>ALL ANIMALS ARE UNDER STRINGENT SELECTION PRESSURE TO BE AS STUPID AS THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH.</p> <p>&#x2014;PETE RICHERSON AND ROBERT BOYD</p> <p>DEEP IN THE Oregon desert, crazy as a prophet, Daniel Br�ks opened his eyes to the usual litany of death warrants.</p> <p>It had been a slow night. A half-dozen traps on the east side were offline&#x2014;damn booster station must have gone down again&#x2014;and most of the others were empty. But number eighteen had caught a garter snake. A sage grouse pecked nervously at the lens in number thirteen. The video feed from number four wasn&#x2019;t working, but judging by mass and thermal there was probably a juvenile <i>Scleroperus</i> scrambling around in there. Twenty-three had caught a hare.</p> <p>Br�ks hated doing the hares. They smelled awful when you cut them open&#x2014;and these days, you almost always had to cut them open.</p> <p>He sighed and described a semicircle with his index finger; the feeds vanished from the skin of his tent. Headlines resolved in their wake, defaulting to past interests: Pakistan&#x2019;s ongoing zombie problem; first anniversary of the Redeemer blowout; a sad brief obituary for the last wild coral reef.</p> <p>Nothing from Rho.</p> <p>Another gesture and the fabric lit with soft tactical overlays, skewed to thermal: public-domain real-time satellite imagery of the Prineville Reserve. His tent squatted in the center of the display, a diffuse yellow smudge: cold crunchy outer shell, warm chewy center. No comparable hot spots anywhere else in range. Br�ks nodded to himself, satisfied. The world continued to leave him alone.</p> <p>Outside, invisible in the colorless predawn, some small creature skittered away across loose rattling rock as he emerged. His breath condensed in front of him; frost crunched beneath his boots, bestowed a faint transient sparkle to the dusty desert floor. His ATB leaned against one of the scraggly larches guarding the camp, marshmallow tires soft and flaccid.</p> <p>He grabbed mug and filter from their makeshift hook and stepped into the open, down a loose jumble of scree. The vestiges of some half-assed desert stream quenched his thirst at the foot of the slope, slimy and sluggish and doomed to extinction within the month. Enough to keep one large mammal watered in the meantime. Out across the valley the Bicamerals&#x2019; pet tornado squirmed feebly against a gray eastern sky but stars were still visible overhead, icy, unwinking, and utterly meaningless. Nothing up there tonight but entropy, and the same imaginary shapes that people had been imposing on nature since they&#x2019;d first thought to wonder at the heavens.</p> <p>It had been a different desert fourteen years ago. A different night. But it had <i>felt</i> the same, until the moment he&#x2019;d glanced up&#x2014;and for a few shattering moments it had even been a different <i>sky,</i> robbed of all randomness. A sky where every star blazed in brilliant precise formation, where every constellation was a perfect square no matter how desperately human imaginations might strain. February 13, 2082. The night of First Contact: sixty-two thousand objects of unknown origin, clenching around the world in a great grid, screaming across the radio spectrum as they burned. Br�ks remembered the feeling: as though he were witnessing some heavenly coup, a capricious god deposed and order restored.</p> <p>The revolution had lasted only a few seconds. The upstaged constellations had reasserted themselves as soon as those precise friction trails had faded from the upper atmosphere. But the damage had been done, Br�ks knew. The sky would never look the same again.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s what he&#x2019;d thought at the time, anyway. That&#x2019;s what everyone had thought. The whole damn species had come together in the wake of that common threat, even if they didn&#x2019;t know what it was exactly, even if it hadn&#x2019;t actually <i>threatened</i> anything but Humanity&#x2019;s own self-importance. The world had put its petty differences aside, spared no expense, thrown together the best damn ship the twenty-first century could muster. They&#x2019;d crewed it with expendable bleeding-edgers and sent them off along some best-guess bearing, carrying a phrase book that spelled <i>take me to your leader</i> in a thousand languages.</p> <p>The world had been holding its breath for over a decade now, waiting for the Second Coming. There&#x2019;d been no encore, no second act. Fourteen years is a long time for a species raised on instant gratification. Br�ks had never considered himself a great believer in the nobility of the Human spirit but even he had been surprised at how little time it took for the sky to start looking the same as it always had, at the speed with which the world&#x2019;s petty differences returned to the front page. People, he reflected, were like frogs: take something out of their visual field, and they&#x2019;d just&#x2014;forget it.</p> <p>The <i>Theseus</i> mission would be well past Pluto by now. If it had found anything, Br�ks hadn&#x2019;t heard about it. For his part, he was sick of waiting. He was sick of life on hold, waiting for monsters or saviors to make an appearance. He was sick of killing things, sick of dying inside.</p> <p>Fourteen years.</p> <p>He wished the world would just hurry up and end.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>He spent the morning as he&#x2019;d spent every other for the past two months: running his traplines and poking the things inside, in the faint hope of finding some piece of nature left untwisted.</p> <p>The clouds were already closing in by sunrise, before his bike had soaked up a decent charge; he left it behind and ran the transects on foot. It was almost noon by the time he got to the hare, only to find that something had beaten him to the punch. The trap had been torn open and its contents emptied by some other predator who&#x2019;d lacked even the good grace to leave a blood spatter behind for analysis.</p> <p>The garter snake was still slithering around in number eighteen, though: a male, one of those brown-on-brown morphs that vanished against the dirt. It writhed in Br�ks&#x2019;s grasp, clenched around his forearm like a scaly tentacle; its scent glands smeared stink across his skin. Br�ks drew a few microliters of blood without much hope, plugged them into the barcoder on his belt. He swigged from his canteen while the device worked its magic.</p> <p>Far across the desert the monastery&#x2019;s tornado had swollen to three times its predawn size, pumped by the midday heat. Distance reduced it to a brown thread, an insignificant smoky smudge; but get too close to that funnel and you&#x2019;d end up scattered over half the valley. Just the year before, some Ugandan vendetta theocracy had hacked a transAt shuttle out of Dartmouth, sent it through a vortex engine on the outskirts of Johannesburg. Not much but rivets and teeth had come out the other side.</p> <p>The barcoder meeped in plaintive surrender: too many genetic artifacts for a clean read. Br�ks sighed, unsurprised. The little machine could tag any gut parasite from the merest speck of shit, ID any host species from the smallest shred of pure tissue&#x2014;but pure tissue was so hard to come by, these days. There was always something that didn&#x2019;t belong. Viral DNA, engineered for the greater good but too indiscriminate to stay on target. Special marker genes, designed to make animals glow in the dark when exposed to some toxin the EPA had lost interest in fifty years before. Even DNA computers, custom-built for a specific task and then tramped carelessly into wild genotypes like muddy footprints on a pristine floor. Nowadays it seemed like half the technical data on the planet were being stored genetically. Try sequencing a lung fluke and it was even money whether the base pairs you read would code for protein or the technical specs on the Denver sewer system.</p> <p>It was okay, though. Br�ks was an old man, a field man from a day when people could tell what they were looking at by&#x2014;well, by <i>looking</i> at it. Check the chin shields. Count the fin rays, the hooks on the scolex. Use your <i>eyes,</i> dammit. At least if you screw up you&#x2019;ve only got yourself to blame, not some dumb-ass machine that can&#x2019;t tell the difference between cytochrome oxidase and a Shakespearean sonnet. And if the things you&#x2019;re trying to ID happen to live inside <i>other</i> things, you kill the host. You cut it open.</p> <p>Br�ks was good at that, too. He&#x2019;d never got around to liking it much, though.</p> <p>Now he whispered to his latest victim&#x2014;&#x201c;<i>Shhh&nbsp;&#x2026; sorry&nbsp;&#x2026; it won&#x2019;t hurt, I promise&#x2026;&#x201d;</i>&#x2014;and dropped it into the kill sack. He&#x2019;d found himself doing that a lot lately, murmuring meaningless comforting lies to victims who couldn&#x2019;t possibly understand what he was saying. He kept telling himself to grow up. In all the billions of years that life had been iterating on this planet, had any predator ever tried to comfort its prey? Had &#x201c;natural&#x201d; death ever been so quick and painless as the killings Dan Br�ks inflicted for the greater good? And yet it still bothered him to see those small diffuse shadows flopping and squirming behind the translucent white plastic, to hear the soft thumps and hisses as simple minds tried to drive bodies, suddenly and terrifyingly unresponsive, toward some kind of imaginary escape.</p> <p>At least these deaths served a purpose, some constructive end transcending the disease or predation that nature would have inflicted. Life was a struggle to exist at the expense of other life. Biology was a struggle to understand life. And this particular bit of biology, this study of which he was author, principal, and sole investigator&#x2014;this was a struggle to use biology to help the very populations he was sampling. These deaths were the closest that Darwin&#x2019;s universe would ever come to altruism.</p> <p><i>And that,</i> said the little voice that always seemed to boot up at times like this, <i>is so much shit. The only thing you&#x2019;re struggling to do is wring a few more publications out of your grant before the funding dries up. Even if you nailed down every change inflicted on every clade over the past hundred years, even if you quantified species loss down to the molecules, it wouldn&#x2019;t matter.</i></p> <p><i>Nobody cares. The only thing you&#x2019;re struggling against is reality.</i></p> <p>That voice had become his constant companion over the years. He let it rant. <i>Either way,</i> he told it after it had run down, <i>we&#x2019;re a shitty biologist</i>. And while his own guilty plea came easily enough, he could not bring himself to feel shame on that account.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>It had stopped being a snake by the time he got back to camp. He stretched the limp and lifeless remains along the dissecting tray. Four seconds with the scasers and it was gutted, throat to cloaca; twenty more and the GI and respiratory tracts floated in separate watch glasses. The intestine would have the heaviest parasite load; Br�ks loaded the GI tract into the &#x2019;scope and got to work.</p> <p>Twenty minutes later, a retinue of flukes and cestodes only half-cataloged, something exploded in the distance.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s what it sounded like, anyway: the soft muffled <i>whoompf</i> of far-off ordinance. Br�ks rose from his work, panned the desert between spindly gnarled trunks.</p> <p>Nothing. Nothing. Noth&#x2014;</p> <p><i>Oh, wait&nbsp;&#x2026; </i></p> <p>The monastery.</p> <p>He grabbed his goggles off the ATB and zoomed in. The tornado was the first thing to draw his eye&#x2014;</p> <p><i>&#x2014;That thing&#x2019;s going pretty strong for so late in the day&#x2014;</i></p> <p>&#x2014;but off to the right, directly over the monastery itself, a puff of dark brown smoke roiled and drifted and dissipated in the lowering light.</p> <p>The building didn&#x2019;t seem to be damaged, though. At least, none of the fa�ades he could see.</p> <p><i>What are they doing over there?</i></p> <p>Physics, officially. Cosmology. High-energy stuff. But it was all supposed to be theoretical; as far as Br�ks knew the Bicameral Order didn&#x2019;t perform actual experiments. Of course, hardly anyone did, these days. It was machines that scanned the heavens, machines that probed the space between atoms, machines that asked the questions and designed the experiments to answer them. All that was left for mere meat, apparently, was navel-gazing: to sit in the desert and contemplate whatever answers those machines served up. Although most still preferred to call it <i>analysis</i>.</p> <p>A hive mind that spoke in tongues: that was how the Bicamerals did it, supposedly. Some kind of bioradio in their heads, a communal corpus callosum: electrons jiggling around in microtubules, some kind of quantum-entanglement thing. Completely organic to get around the ban on B2B interfaces. A spigot that poured many minds into one on command. They flowed together and called down the Rapture, rolled around the floor and drooled and ululated while their acolytes took notes, and somehow they ended up rewriting the Amplituhedron.</p> <p>There was supposed to be some rational explanation to justify the mumbo jumbo. Left-hemisphere pattern-matching subroutines amped beyond recognition; the buggy wetware that made you see faces in clouds or God&#x2019;s wrath in thunderstorms, tweaked to walk some fine line between insight and pareidolia. Apparently there were fundamental insights to be harvested along that razor&#x2019;s edge, patterns that only the Bicamerals could distinguish from hallucination. That was the story, anyway. It sounded like utter bullshit to Br�ks.</p> <p>Still, you couldn&#x2019;t argue with the Nobels.</p> <p>Maybe they had some kind of particle accelerator over there after all. They had to be doing <i>something</i> that sucked a lot of energy; nobody used an industrial vortex engine to run kitchen appliances.</p> <p>From behind, the metallic tinkle of displaced instruments.

Russell Culver is fifteen in 1904, and he's raring to leave his tiny Indiana farm town for the endless sky of the Dakotas. To him, school has been nothing but a chain holding him back from his dreams. Maybe now that his teacher has passed on, they'll shut the school down entirely and leave him free to roam.<p>No such luck. Russell has a particularly eventful season of schooling ahead of him, led by a teacher he never could have predicted-perhaps the only teacher equipped to control the likes of him: his sister Tansy. Despite stolen supplies, a privy fire, and more than any classroom's share of snakes, Tansy will manage to keep that school alive and maybe, just maybe, set her brother on a new, wiser course.</p></p><p><p>RICHARD PECK (1934-2018) was born in Decatur, Illinois and lived in New York City for nearly 50 years. The acclaimed author of 35 novels for children and young adults, he won the Newbery Medal for<i>&nbsp;A Year Down Yonder</i>, a Newbery Honor for&nbsp;<i>A Long Way from Chicago</i>, the Scott O&#x2019;Dell Award for&nbsp;<i>The River Between Us</i>, the Edgar Allen Poe Award for&nbsp;<i>Are You in the House Alone?</i>, a&nbsp;<i>Boston Globe-Horn Book</i>Award Honor for&nbsp;<i>The Best Man</i>, and the Christopher Medal for&nbsp;<i>The Teacher&#x2019;s Funeral</i>. He was the first children&#x2019;s author ever to have been awarded a National Humanities Medal, and was twice a National Book Award Finalist.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p><b>Chapter One </b><p>August </p><p>If your teacher has to die, August isn't a bad time of year for it. You know August. The corn is earring. The tomatoes are ripening on the vine. The clover's in full bloom. There's a little less evening now, and that's a warning. You want to live every day twice over because you'll be back in the jailhouse of school before the end of the month. </p><p>Then our teacher, Miss Myrt Arbuckle, hauled off and died. It was like a miracle, though she must have been forty. You should have seen my kid brother's face. It looked like Lloyd was hearing the music of the spheres. Being ten that summer, he was even more willing to believe in miracles than I was. </p><p>You couldn't deny Miss Myrt Arbuckle was past her prime. She was hard of hearing in one ear, no doubt deafened by her own screaming. And she couldn't whup us like she wanted to. She was a southpaw for whupping, and she had arthritis in that elbow, so while she could still whup, it didn't make much of an impression. &nbsp; </p><p>Back in the spring when she called up Lester Kriegbaum for some infraction, nothing serious, he brought a book to the front of the room and read it over her knee while she larruped away at his far end. </p><p>So when you get right down to it, if you can't hear and you can't whup, you're better off dead than teaching. That's how I looked at it. </p><p>There was always talk about shutting down Hominy Ridge School anyhow. Now that me and Lloyd saw its end might be nigh, hope broke over us. It was surely too late to find another teacher who'd teach in a place like that. </p><p>Hominy Ridge was nothing but an out-of-date, unimproved, one-room country schoolhouse in the backwoodsiest corner of Indiana. They admitted it didn't pay to keep it just for us straggle of kids who went there. </p><p>Dad was on the school board. Me and Lloyd hoped to encourage him to close down the school and drive all formal education out of this part of Parke County. For one thing, I'd been fifteen since winter and still hadn't passed the eighth-grade graduation exam. &nbsp; </p><p>Besides, I had me a dream, and school only stood in my way. </p><p> "Russell, will they have a funeral for Miss Myrt?" Lloyd looked up at me, wondering. </p><p>"Of course they'll have a funeral for her," I said. "Did you think they'd just feed her to the hogs?" </p><p>But I know how Lloyd thought. Regular people have funerals, but Miss Myrt was a teacher. As for a funeral, it was hot weather and the crops were in the ground and the roads were dry and the fair was over. "What else do people have to do?" I said. "They'll turn out for Miss Myrt." </p><p> "They better," Lloyd said darkly. "She's liable to set up in her coffin and take roll." </p><p><b>Chapter Two </b></p><p>The Best Boys in the World </p><p>How we learned that Miss Myrt Arbuckle had turned up her toes gets ahead of the story. This news didn't reach us till almost midnight, and then under dramatic circumstances. </p><p>But it had been a red-letter day anyhow, the main day of the year for me, better than the 4 th of July. It was the day the J.I. Case Company of Racine, Wisconsin, sent their special train down through Indiana. We'd watched for the flyers announcing it all summer. My heart was in my mouth that Dad wouldn't let us go. </p><p>The Case Special came through every August with flatcars of the latest in steam engines and threshing machines. It was better than a circus. Every man and boy from twenty miles around converged on Montezuma to see the Case Special. I walked the floor all night for fear Dad would keep us in the field. I hadn't figured out he wouldn't have missed the Case Special himself. </p><p>Me and Lloyd were up ahead of the chickens. We worked a seven-day week anyway, even in this quiet season. As Dad said, the only man who got his work done by Friday was Robinson Crusoe. And we were a corn, wheat, hay, and hogs farm in a never-ending round of chores, plus the milking. Today me and Lloyd were a pair of whirlwinds--two tornadoes back and forth to the barn a dozen times before breakfast. And it was already hot enough to fry your brains through your hat. </p><p>Then we pulled cockleburs out of the corn into the heat of the day. Cockleburs have two seeds that mature at different times, so you have to kill them twice. All the while, one cricket after another walked in under our hickory shirts on bobwire legs and made life a misery. Still, we worked ahead of Dad all morning, the best boys in the world, and Dad never let on that he knew why. </p><p>You talk about hot. They don't make Augusts like that anymore. An old horsethief from just over in Putnam County died and went down to Hades. And he sent back for a blanket. That's the kind of heat we were used to. At long last we heard the dinner bell sound from the house. </p><p>When we came to the end of the row, we saw Dad up in the lot, bent over the horse trough. He wasn't just washing a little bit for the dinner table. He was washing his whole top half. That meant he was fixing to go to town. Lloyd was ready to rip out a whoop, but I put a lid on him. We weren't there yet. </p><p>I thought if we had to take the time to sit down to dinner, we'd be too late to see the Case Special come in. But the hand that rang the dinner bell was our sister Tansy's. And if she cooked, you sat and ate it. </p><p>Tansy was named for a wildflower, which suited her because she was as countrified and rawboned as me and Lloyd, almost. She was our big sister--great big, and she loomed over our lives. </p><p>"Let's see those hands." Tansy gave the back of my head a painful thump. There was no arthritis in her elbows. She had a pancake turner in her other hand, so I showed her my palms. </p><p>"Well, I see where you've been," she remarked, and she didn't mean the trough. She passed along to Lloyd. "You should have left more of the field where it was," said she after a look at his paws. </p><p>"We washed," Lloyd whined. I had the sense to keep quiet. "We washed in the trough, same as Dad." </p><p>Dad obliged by turning up his palms, but Tansy thought Lloyd deserved the same thump she'd given me. She was fair that way. "Ow!" Lloyd exclaimed. </p><p>&nbsp; "Do you have such a thing as a lump of soap down at the trough?" Tansy inquired. </p><p>"No," said Lloyd, who never learned. "It'd gag the horses. They'd foam at the mouth." </p><p>Dad gazed out the door and down the corn rows, trying not to smile. </p><p>"Now I see your neck and ears," Tansy told Lloyd, "I'm gagging myself." </p><p>"Let'em be so they can eat," Aunt Maud called out from the stove. I was wolfing it down already, crazy to head for town. But we had a good big dinner to get through first: chicken-fried steak, boiled potatoes and cream gravy, a platter of dead-ripe, deep red beefsteak tomatoes, and a pyramid of pickled peaches in the cut-glass dish. We were being force-fed last year's pickled peaches to make way for this year's. </p><p>Aunt Maud pulled down the oven door and drew out a sheet of her drop biscuits. Dad's thorny hand covered his eyes. Aunt Maud was the worst baker in the United States. You couldn't use her dough balls for bait. </p><p>She was no better a cook. We lived for summer because Tansy was home to do most of the cooking for us. In the fall she went back to board in town, to go to the high school. Why Tansy needed to go to high school was another of life's mysteries to me. </p><p>"Pie's pretty nearly baked!" she declared. "Who wants a slab?" But by then Lloyd was halfway to the back door, and Dad was right on his heels. </p><p>We hitched up Siren and Stentor to the spring wagon and off we went along the boiling roads. Somehow we made it to town with minutes to spare. It beat me why Tansy and Aunt Maud didn't want to go. </p><p>"Gawk at a bunch of implements in the Montezuma railroad yard with all those cinders underfoot?" Tansy said. "I thank you, no." </p><p>It occurred to me even that early in life that there's not much romance in a woman's soul. The very names of the big steam threshers turned my heart over: the Geiser Peerless, the Minnesota Little Giant, the Avery Yellow Fellow, the Pitts Challenger, the Frick Eclipse. </p><p>Finally our wagon was in a row with others, down the hill into town. This was the biggest crowd we saw from one year to the next. An acre of wagons drew up by the depot. Two hundred straw hats bobbed against the punishing sun, and not a bonnet among us. </p><p>This is how I pictured Indianapolis, this crush of humankind with nary a familiar face. I looked for my best friend, Charlie Parr, but didn't see him. Of course he could have been an arm's length away, and I wouldn't know. You could scarcely draw breath, and not every farmer had stopped by the trough on the way here. </p><p>Then in the farthest distance we heard a trill. It was the steam calliope on the Case Special, flinging a tune to the four winds. The sound of music coming down the tracks made every hair on my head stand up. Though he was too big to hold my hand, Lloyd had me in a grip. It was the Case Special. </p><p>Smoke billowed, and the whistle screamed as the train roared in. The shrieking brakes set, and live steam singed our bare feet. On the car past the calliope a Farmer's Friend wind stacker blew out circulars and handbills instead of chaff. Paper and then tin buttons with the Case eagle on them rained over us. </p><p>Now we were waiting for Uncle Sam and the Gold Dust Twins because we wanted every year to be just like last year. As the calliope swung into "Marching Through Georgia," Uncle Sam unfolded himself out of the caboose. He stood over us, twelve feet tall in spangled top hat and stilts. </p><p>But we were lost to him. The Gold Dust Twins couldn't hold us either, even when they bucked-and-winged into "Under the Bamboo Tree" and threw soapy scouring pads for our womenfolk. A cloud passed, and the full glare of the sun fell on this year's 1904 models of the Case Agitator threshing machine. </p><p>They were steel. </p><p>Threshing machines had been wooden-sided from the beginning. But these monsters were sheet steel. We were blinded by their sheen. The twentieth century had found us at last, even here. We didn't know how to look at something so new. A lump formed in my throat. </p><p>Now Uncle Sam was calling somebody up out of the mob. An Agitator was fired up and steaming. Somebody was wanted to feed lumber into the rig to prove how rugged these new steel models were. If the Agitator could do this to hardwood, think what it could do to your wheat crop. </p><p>The face Uncle Sam lit upon was Charlie Parr's. He was older than me, though he hadn't passed the eighth-grade graduation examination either. He swung up on the flatcar and commenced feeding stove lengths into the Agitator. The sawdust blew a dry cloudburst over us. </p><p>My mind was miles away by then, up in the Dakotas. I caught a glimpse of me up there for the wheat harvest. I was working one of these all-steel Case Agitators across the thousand-mile fields, under endless sky. I saw me doing a man's work on a crew of men who'd logged all winter. I felt the chaff in my hair. </p><p>All I wanted was to be on a threshing crew, to be in the stubble fields on crisp mornings like the dawn of creation. When I'd get back after the harvest I couldn't tell you. How cold it got up there I didn't know. But that was my dream, and school stood between me and it. </p>Lloyd tightened his grip on me. He knew I was fixing to go, that in my heart I was already gone.</p><h2>Tailchaser&#39;s Song (Daw Book Collectors)</h2><p>Fifteen years ago, a young author surprised and enchanted readers with his first novel&#x2014;the story of Fritti Tailchaser, a courageous tom cat in a world of whiskery heroes and villains, of feline gods and strange, furless creatures called M'an.<p>The book was <b>Tailchaser's Song</b>, the author was <b>Tad Williams</b>.The legend was born. </p></p><p><b>Tad Williams</b> has held more jobs than any sane person should admit to&#x2014;singing in a band, selling shoes, managing a financial institution, throwing newspapers, and designing military manuals, to name just a few.

Climbfast, Wolf-friend, Treesinger, and Brightnail, their young, were strong of tooth, sharp of eye, light of foot, and straight and brave to their tail-ends. </p><p>But most strange and beautiful of all the countless children of Harar and Fela were the three Firstborn. </p><p>The eldest of the Firstborn was Viror Whitewind; he was the color of sunlight on snow, and of swiftness.... </p><p>The middle child was Grizraz Hearteater, as gray as shadows and full of strangeness.... </p><p>Third-born was Tangaloor Firefoot. He was as black as Meerclar Allmother, but his paws were red like flame. He walked alone, and sang to himself. </p><p>There was rivalry among the Firstborn brothers. Whitewind was as fast and strong as a cat could dream of being&#x2014;none could overmatch him at jumping and running. Firefoot was as clever as time; he solved all puzzles and riddles, and made songs that the Folk sang for generations. </p><p>Hearteater could not match his brothers' exploits. He grew jealous, and began to plot the downfall of Whitewind and the humiliation of the Folk. </p><p>So it came to pass that Hearteater raised up a great beast against the Folk. Ptomalkum was it's name, and it was the last spawn of the demon-hound Venris, whom Meerclar had destroyed in the Days of Fire. Ptomalkum, raised and nurtured with Hearteater's hatred, slew many Folk before it was itself slain by the gallant Whitewind. But Viror Whitewind received such wounds that he soon wasted and died. Seeing the downfall of his schemes, Hearteater was afraid, and crept down a hole and disappeared into the secretive earth. </p><p>There was great lamentation in the Court of Harar at the death of Whitewind, the best-beloved. Firefoot his brother fled the Court in heartache, renouncing his claim to the Mantle of Kingship, and wandered the world. </p><p>Fela Skydancer, Whitewind's mother, was ever after silent, all her long life. </p><p>But Harar Goldeneye was so full of rage that he wept, and swore great oaths. He went howling into the wilderness, destroying all before him in his search for the traitorous Hearteater. Finally, unable to bear such great pain, he fled to the bosom of the Allmother in the sky. There he still lives, chasing the bright mouse of the sun across the heavens. Often he looks down to earth below, hoping to see Viror running once more beneath the trees of the World-Forest. </p><p>Countless seasons turned and the world grew older before Firefoot again met his treacherous brother Hearteater. </p><p>In the days of Prince Cleanwhisker, in the reign of Queen Morningstripe, Lord Tangaloor came to the assistance of the Ruhue, the owl-folk. A mysterious creature had been pillaging their nests, and had killed all the Ruhu hunters who had come against it. </p><p>Firefoot laid a trap, clawing away at a mighty tree until it was near cut through, then lay in wait for the marauder. </p><p>When the creature came that night, and Firefoot felled the tree, he was astonished to discover that beneath it he had trapped Grizraz Hearteater. </p><p>Hearteater begged Firefoot to free him, promising that he would share the ancient lore that he had discovered beneath the ground. Lord Tangaloor only laughed. </p><p>When the sun came up, Hearteater began to scream. He writhed and screeched so that Firefoot, although fearing a trick, liberated his suffering brother from beneath the pinioning tree. </p><p>Hearteater had been so long beneath the earth that the sun was blinding him. He clawed and rubbed at his steaming eyes, howling so piteously that Firefoot looked about for a way to protect him from the burning of the day-star. But when he turned away, the blinded Hearteater dug himself a tunnel, more swiftly than any badger or mole. By the time the startled Firefoot bounded over, Hearteater had disappeared back into the belly of the world. </p><p>It is told that he still lives there, hidden from the eyes of the Folk; that he works foul deeds underground, and aches to return to the World Above.... </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Book of Revelation Study Guide</h2><p>A simple but inspiring, verse-by-verse guide to the book of Revelation, with a glossary of terms and symbols, and in-depth articles and charts.

Everyone has them, but no one knows what they mean. People are curious about and often confused by the things that arouse them, yet they are often too ashamed to reveal their most private fantasies to their partners or even their therapists. In this fascinating and provocative book, Dr. Michael J. Bader offers a groundbreaking new theory of sexual desire, one that will liberate men and women and enable them to better understand their sexual preferences. </p><p>Drawing on his twenty-five years as a psychotherapist and psychoanalyst, Dr. Bader demonstrates that rather than being programmed by biology or society, sexual fantasies and preferences are really psychological antidotes to unconscious dangers. Armed with this novel theory, men and women will no longer need to feel ashamed about what arouses them or confused about what arouses others. Dr. Bader sensitively tells the stories of his patients and explains the meaning of their sexual fantasies. In terms refreshingly free of jargon, he reveals how his profound new theory can be used to decipher a wide variety of sexual fantasies and behavior, ranging from ordinary preferences about positions in bed to flamboyant scenarios worthy of the Marquis de Sade. And yet, Dr. Bader's exciting new theory transcends the realm of individual psychology. Readers will come away with a radically new understanding of such issues as sexual chemistry and boredom, cybersex, pornography, and the differences in how men and women get excited.</p><p>Both erudite and accessible, <i>Arousal</i><i>: The Secret Logic of Sexual Fantasies</i> is an important landmark in the literature of sexuality.</p></p><p>"The function of sexual fantasy is to undo the beliefs and feelings interfering with sexual excitement, to ensure both our safety and our pleasure," writes clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst Michael Bader. In <i>Arousal</i>, Bader discusses the role of sexual fantasy as an unconscious problem solver and describes how his patients have come to understand the background, logic, and positive messages of their fantasies. Bader offers case studies of patients (heterosexual and gay) with varied conflicts, and analyzes their sexual fantasies in light of their desires, guilt, and past and current relationships. Most patients, Bader found, are able to resolve their issues by understanding the meaning and logic of their fantasies and then move on to more satisfying relationships.<p> Bader also interprets common sex fantasies and discusses sexual boredom in ongoing relationships, the power of pathogenic (irrational and self-defeating) beliefs, and sexual fantasies as a therapeutic key to problems that seem independent of sexuality, such as depression. </p><p> This provocative book is scholarly yet accessible to the lay reader interested in psychology. Although readers might be drawn in by the gritty, sexy details about Bader's patients, thoughtful readers also will learn about themselves and what their own fantasies may be addressing and revealing. <i>--Joan Price</i></p><p><b>Dr. Michael J.

An apprentice of Mark English, Mr. Cooper began his freelance career while still a student at the University of Oklahoma. After graduating, he made his way to Missouri, where he secured a position at a greeting card company. Although Mr. Cooper was established in his position there, he felt somewhat stifled. He lacked the freedom and opportunity for spontaneity that he longed for as an artist and the joy that could be found in doing something that he loved. Determined to break out of the mundane cycle he found himself in, Mr. Cooper relocated to the East Coast in 1984 to pursue his career further. It was there that he discovered the world of children's book illustrating and was amazed by the opportunities for creativity it afforded. Mr. Cooper was energized. The first book he illustrated,&nbsp;<i>Grandpa's Face</i>, captivated reviewers.&nbsp;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>&nbsp;said of newcomer Floyd Cooper's work, "Cooper, in his first picture book, creates family scenes of extraordinary illumination.

And the way he keeps nodding and flicking his Zippo open and closed in rhythm with his head. He belongs in a chorus line of dancing Jets and Sharks.<br>Then again, I have an eye for these things. I know what to look for, because I&#x2019;ve seen just about every variety of spook and specter you can imagine.<br>The hitchhiker haunts a stretch of winding North Carolina road, bordered by unpainted split-rail fences and a whole lot of nothing. Unsuspecting drivers probably pick him up out of boredom, thinking he&#x2019;s just some college kid who reads too much Kerouac.<br>&#x201c;My gal, she&#x2019;s waiting for me,&#x201d; he says now in an excited voice, like he&#x2019;s going to see her the minute we crest the next hill. He taps the lighter hard on the dash, twice, and I glance over to make sure he hasn&#x2019;t left a ding in the panel. This isn&#x2019;t my car. And I&#x2019;ve suffered through eight weeks of lawn work for Mr. Dean, the retired army colonel who lives down the block, just so I could borrow it. For a seventy-year-old man he&#x2019;s got the straightest back I&#x2019;ve ever seen. If I had more time, I could&#x2019;ve spent a summer listening to interesting stories about Vietnam. Instead I cleared shrubs and tilled an eight-by-ten plot for new rosebushes while he watched me with a surly eye, making sure his baby would be safe with this seventeen-year-old kid in an old Rolling Stones t-shirt and his mother&#x2019;s gardening gloves.<br>To tell the truth, knowing what I was going to use the car for, I felt a little guilty. It&#x2019;s a dusk blue 1969 Camaro Rally Sport, mint condition. Drives smooth as silk and growls around curves. I can&#x2019;t believe he let me take it, yard work or no. But thank god he did, because without it I would have been sunk. It was something the hitchhiker would go for&#x2014;something worth the trouble of crawling out of the ground.<br>&#x201c;She must be pretty nice,&#x201d; I say without much interest.<br>&#x201c;Yeah, man, yeah,&#x201d; he says and, for the hundredth time since I picked him up five miles ago, I wonder how anyone could possibly not know that he&#x2019;s dead. He sounds like a James Dean movie. And then there&#x2019;s the smell. Not quite rotten but definitely mossy, hanging around him like a fog. How has anyone mistaken him for the living? How has anyone kept him in the car for the ten miles it takes to get to the Lowren&#x2019;s Bridge, where he inevitably grabs the wheel and takes both car and driver into the river? &nbsp;Most likely they were creeped out by his clothes and his voice, and by the smell of bones&#x2014;that smell they seem to know even though they&#x2019;ve probably never smelled it. But by then it&#x2019;s always too late. They&#x2019;d made the decision to pick up a hitchhiker, and they weren&#x2019;t about to let themselves be scared into going back on it. They rationalized their fears away. People shouldn&#x2019;t do that.<br>In the passenger seat, the hitchhiker is still talking in this faraway voice about his girl back home, somebody named Lisa, and how she&#x2019;s got the shiniest blond hair and the prettiest red smile, and how they&#x2019;re going to run off and get married as soon as he gets back hitching from Florida. He was working part of a summer down there for his uncle at a car dealership: the best opportunity to save up for their wedding, even if it did mean they wouldn&#x2019;t see each other for months.<br>&#x201c;It must&#x2019;ve been hard, being away from home so long,&#x201d; I say, and there&#x2019;s actually a little bit of pity in my voice. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;ll be glad to see you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, man. That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m talking about. I&#x2019;ve got everything we need, right in my jacket pocket. We&#x2019;ll get married and move out to the coast. I&#x2019;ve got a pal out there, Robby. We can stay with him until I get a job working on cars.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I say. The hitchhiker has this sadly optimistic look on his face, lit up by the moon and the glowing dashlights. He never saw Robby, of course. He never saw his girl Lisa, either. Because two miles up the road in the summer of 1970, he got into a car, probably a lot like this one. And he told whoever was driving that he had a way to start an entire life in his coat pocket.<br>The locals say that they beat him up pretty good by the bridge and then dragged him back into the trees, where they stabbed him a couple of times and then cut his throat. They pushed his body down an embankment and into one of the tributary streams. That&#x2019;s where a farmer found it, nearly six months later, wound around with vines, the jaw hanging open in surprise, like he still couldn&#x2019;t believe that he was stuck there.<br>And now he doesn&#x2019;t know that he&#x2019;s stuck here. None of them ever seem to know. Right now the hitchhiker is whistling and bobbing along to nonexistent music. He probably still hears whatever they were playing the night they killed him.<br>He&#x2019;s perfectly pleasant. A nice guy to ride with. But when we get to that bridge, he&#x2019;ll be as angry and ugly as anyone you&#x2019;ve ever seen. It&#x2019;s reported that his ghost, dubbed unoriginally as the County 12 Hiker, has killed at least a dozen people and injured another eight. But I can&#x2019;t really blame him. He never made it home to see his girl, and now he doesn&#x2019;t want anyone else to get home either.<br>We pass mile marker twenty-three&#x2014;the bridge is less than two minutes away. I&#x2019;ve driven this road almost every night since we moved here in the hopes that I would catch his thumb in my headlights, but I had no luck. Not until I got behind the wheel of this Rally Sport. Before this it was just half a summer of the same damn road, the same damn blade tucked under my leg. I hate it when it&#x2019;s like that, like some kind of horribly extended fishing trip. But I don&#x2019;t give up on them. They always come around in the end.<br>I let my foot ease up on the gas.<br>&#x201c;Something wrong, friend?&#x201d; he asks me.<br>I shake my head. &#x201c;Only that this isn&#x2019;t my car, and I don&#x2019;t have the cash to fix it if you decide to try to take me off the bridge.&#x201d;<br>The hitchhiker laughs, just a little too loudly to be normal. &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;ve been drinking or something tonight, pal. Maybe you ought to just let me off here.&#x201d;<br>I realize too late that I shouldn&#x2019;t have said that. I can&#x2019;t let him out. It&#x2019;d be my luck that he&#x2019;d step out and disappear. I&#x2019;m going to have to kill him while the car is moving or I&#x2019;ll have to do this all over again, and I doubt that Mr. Dean is willing to let the car go for too many more nights. Besides, I&#x2019;m moving to Thunder Bay in three days.<br>There&#x2019;s also the thought that I&#x2019;m doing this to this poor bastard all over again. But that thought is fleeting. He&#x2019;s already dead.<br>I try to keep the speedometer over fifty&#x2014;too fast for him to really consider jumping out, but with ghosts you can never be sure. I&#x2019;ll have to work fast.<br>It&#x2019;s when I reach down to take my blade out from under the leg of my jeans that I see the silhouette of the bridge in the moonlight. Right on cue, the hitchhiker grabs the wheel and yanks it to the left. I try to jerk it back right and slam my foot on the brake. I hear the sound of angry rubber on asphalt and out of the corner of my eye I can see that the hitchhiker&#x2019;s face is gone. No more easy Joe, no slicked hair and eager smile. He&#x2019;s just a mask of rotten skin and bare, black holes, with teeth like dull stones. It looks like he&#x2019;s grinning, but it might just be the effect of his lips peeling off.<br>Even as the car is fishtailing and trying to stop, I don&#x2019;t have any flashes of my life before my eyes. What would that even be like? A highlight reel of murdered ghosts. Instead I see a series of quick, ordered images of my dead body: one with the steering wheel through my chest, another with my head gone as the rest of me hangs out the missing window.<br>A tree comes up out of nowhere, aimed right for my driver&#x2019;s side door. I don&#x2019;t have time to swear, just to jerk the wheel and hit the gas, and the tree is behind me. What I don&#x2019;t want to do is make it to the bridge. The car is all over the shoulder and the bridge doesn&#x2019;t have one. It&#x2019;s narrow, and wooden, and outdated.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not so bad, being dead,&#x201d; the hitchhiker says to me, clawing at my arm, trying to get me off the wheel.<br>&#x201c;What about the smell?&#x201d; I hiss. Through all of this I haven&#x2019;t lost my grip on my knife handle. Don&#x2019;t ask me how; my wrist feels like the bones are going to separate in about ten seconds, and I&#x2019;ve been pulled off my seat so that I&#x2019;m hovering over the stick shift. I throw the car into neutral with my hip (should have done that earlier) and pull my blade out fast.<br>What happens next is kind of a surprise: the skin comes back onto the hitchhiker&#x2019;s face, and the green comes back into his eyes. He&#x2019;s just a kid, staring at my knife. I get the car back under control and hit the brakes.<br>The jolt from the stop makes him blink. He looks at me.<br>&#x201c;I worked all summer for this money,&#x201d; he says softly. &#x201c;My girl will kill me if I lose it.&#x201d;<br>My heart is pounding from the effort of controlling the lurching car. I don&#x2019;t want to say anything. I just want to get it over with. But instead I hear my voice.<br>&#x201c;Your girl will forgive you.

I&#39;m a student leader!: practical ideas and guidance on leadership Radical leadership If you asked the president of a large company for a oneword definition of leadership, she might describe it as enthusiasm, drive, power, presence, or competence. These words are often associated with the world&#39;s view of leadership. But if you investigate Jesus&#39; leadership requirements for his closest followers, you&#39;ll see that only one word makes it to the top of his list. It&#39;s not an attractive word that will make you want race to the end of this book. Ready? Drum roll, please...Jesus asked his leaders to... serve. Serve! (Go ahead and reread it---I&#39;ll wait.) Is it safe to assume that right now you&#39;re not too sure you want to be a leader if that&#39;s what leaders do? I understand---it&#39;s quite shocking at first. But if you want to follow the lead of Jesus, you&#39;ll fi nd the primary objective of a biblical leader is to serve. Carefully read this verse to understand how Jesus wants his closest followers to act: You know that in this world kings are tyrants, and officials lord it over the people beneath them. But Chapter One Student Leaders Serve among you it should be quite different. Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant... (Matthew 20:25-26, NLT) Jesus&#39; selection of leaders could be considered either insane or ingenious. But since he was God in the flesh, let&#39;s assume his leadership judgment fits in the latter category. The first 12 men he chose to lead with him included five fishermen, a tax collector, and six others whose occupations are a complete mystery. Sometimes we wonder why Jesus chose these men instead of those who were already seen as leaders. Whatever the reason, the greatest leader ever to live chose ordinary guys to lead with him. Clearly, Jesus connected serving to leading. He deepened the definition of leadership when he described himself as a servant rather than a king: &#39;For even I, the Son of Man, came here not to be served but to serve others, and to give my life as a ransom for many&#39; (Matthew 20:28, NLT). Jesus didn&#39;t just speak about serving; he modeled it. He put the needs of others first and placed himself in positions where serving was necessary. Ultimately, this posture of servanthood led him to the cross---to serve the needs of humanity. He served without reservation, and the greatest act of servanthood was also the greatest act of leadership our world has ever seen. Think about that for a moment. Jesus. God in the flesh. All-powerful, all-knowing, all God, and yet, all servant---to everyone! He served the down and out, the sinner, the outcast, the lonely, and the poor. Leader? Yes. Servant? Absolutely! As Jesus served, he created and led a movement with the potential to influence others! Given Jesus&#39; actions, my definition of leadership would include two key words: serve and influence. Jesus did both. That&#39;s leadership! If you want to be a leader---not just a student leader, but a Christian leader---you must learn to lead like Jesus. How? By serving others. When you serve others, you&#39;ll have the opportunity not only to lead, but also to change the image of leadership in your church, in your youth group, in your family, and in your school. So instead of viewing your leadership role as a chance to exert power and voice your opinions, view it as an opportunity to serve. When you do, you&#39;ll succeed at leadership, and you&#39;ll grow to be more like Jesus. Serve...like Jesus The apostle Paul emphasized Jesus&#39; servanthood and humility when he challenged Christians with the following words: Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. (Philippians 2:5-7) Paul told early Christians to be like Jesus (except for the perfection part---which is too bad since walking on water and casting out demons could be scary and fun). What does it mean to be like Jesus? It&#39;s more than wearing a WWJD (What Would Jesus Do) logo...it means taking on his character---being a servant. As you read this book carefully, you&#39;ll see that leadership and service go hand in hand. (I desperately want you to understand this concept before you move on to the next chapter.) As a student leader, if you want to be effective, you&#39;ll need to serve others. Many church-based student leadership programs are populated by the cute, fun, and outgoing kids who win popularity contests within the youth group. That&#39;s the wrong way to choose student leaders. Leadership is not about popularity; it&#39;s about...guess what? Serving. If you don&#39;t serve others, you&#39;re not a Christian leader. I don&#39;t care how popular, charismatic, and wonderful you are...if you want to be a leader, you must be a servant. Get it? (Got it!) Good! Several students were immediately interested when I began to float the idea of creating a student leadership group at our church. But at our first informational meeting, I emphasized that biblical leadership (and leading like Jesus) requires servanthood and humility. Being a biblical leader wouldn&#39;t necessarily mean one would have popularity and power. My words disappointed many students. After that meeting there was a lot less excitement about leadership. Several students wanted to be leaders because they thought they&#39;d be in front of the crowd, make important choices that would affect the ministry calendar, and be consulted on youth group decisions. Servanthood never occurred to them. Our student leadership team was small at the start because very few students were willing to serve. Few were willing to pick up trash, stack chairs, and go out of their way to befriend disinterested and lonely students. In other words, I had a lot of students who wanted to be known as leaders...but not many who wanted to serve as leaders. We were learning about the big difference between biblical and worldly leadership. The backbone of Christian leadership is simple to understand yet very difficult to pull off: Serve. Master this task, and you&#39;ll become a powerful student leader. (If servant doesn&#39;t describe you right now, don&#39;t give up. Just keep reading and pray for God to mold you into the type of leader he wants you to become. Stay with me through the end of the book. I will challenge you, but I&#39;ll be nice, too. I promise.)</p><h2>The Teachings of Abraham Well-Being Cards</h2><p>"I think that Abraham is one of the best teachers on the planet today!"&#x2014; Louise L. Hay, the bestselling author of You Can Heal Your Life "I am a medical doctor and have not, before, run across material that has this much potential to create health.

Each of these 60 cards will accentuate your natural state of well-being.</p><p>Excited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986. Recognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham&#x2019;s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life. Using their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham&#x2019;s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person&#x2014;as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences. In November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry. People are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos. Abraham&#x2014;a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers&#x2014;present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.

He then saw his own brother tied hand and foot, begging his mercy and intercession. He was informed that this person was about to suffer the punishment due for this offense, and that it was reserved for him (the candidate) to be the instrument of this just vengeance, and that this gave him the opportunity of manifesting that he was completely devoted to the order. It being observed that his countenance gave the signs of inward horror he was told, that in order to spare his feelings, a bandage should be put over his eyes. A dagger was put into his right hand, and being hoodwinked, his left hand was laid on the palpitating heart of the criminal, and he was ordered to strike. He instantly obeyed; and when the bandage was taken from his eyes, he saw it was a lamb he had stabbed."</p> <p>"Proofs of a Conspiracy" was written by John Robison, a Scottish professor, to warn Britain and other kingdoms that the forces which toppled the French monarchy and started The Terror were still active. In his book, Robison traced the story of the 1776 founding of the Bavarian Illuminati by Adam Weishaupt, a professor at Ingolstadt and the suppression of the order by the royal and church authorities of Bavaria in 1785. The Illuminists went underground all over Europe and used existing Masonic lodges or set up their own as a cover for their activities. In Paris, the Duc d'Orleans headed the Illuminist front called the Grand Orient Lodge, his base to conspire against the ruling House of Bourbon. The English and Scottish lodges were generally apolitical amd many worked actively to keep out Illuminists as insincere applicants, but Robison maintained that some continental lodges remained hotbeds of revolutionary plotting, and therefore dangerous, at the time he wrote. Robison was a contemporary and collaborator with James Watt (with whom he worked on an early steam car), contributor to the 1797 Encylopedia Britannica, professor of philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, and inventor of the siren. Although Robison was very much an advocate of science and rationalism, he became an ardent monarchist later in life due to his disillusionment with the French Revolution. In "Proofs of a Conspiracy," Robison laid the groundwork for modern conspiracy theorists by implicating the Bavarian Illuminati as responsible for the excesses of the French Revolution. The Bavarian Illuminati had an inner core of true believers, who secretly held radical atheist, anti-monarchist and possibly proto-feminist views, at that time considered beyond the pale. They recruited by infiltrating the numerous (and otherwise benign) Freemasonic groups which were active at the time on the continent. Today, the Illuminati have today become a byword for a secret society which hoodwinks its junior members and puppet-masters society at large-a reputation which is in no little part due to Robison's book.</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <p> INTRODUCTION CHAP. I. SCHISMS IN FREE MASONRY CHAP. II. THE ILLUMINATI CHAP. III. THE GERMAN UNION CHAP. IV. THE FRENCH REVOLUTION POSTSCRIPT</p></p><p>John Robison (1739-1805) was a Scottish physicist and mathematician. He was a professor of philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. A member of the Edinburgh Philosophical Society when it received its royal warrant, he was appointed as the first General Secretary to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Robison invented the siren and also worked with James Watt on an early steam car. Following the French Revolution, Robison became disenchanted with elements of the Enlightenment. He authored Proofs of a Conspiracy in 1797-a polemic accusing Freemasonry of being infiltrated by Weishaupt&#39;s Order of the Illuminati. Robison and French priest Abb� Barruel independently developed similar views that the Illuminati had infiltrated Continental Freemasonry, leading to the excesses of the French Revolution. In 1798, the Reverend G. W. Snyder sent Robison&#39;s book to George Washington for his thoughts on the subject in which he replied to him in his Letter to the Reverend G. W. Snyder (24 October 1798). Modern conspiracy theorists like Nesta Webster and William Guy Carr believe that Robison&#39;s book described what the Illuminati may have started was the template for the subversion of otherwise benign organizations by radical groups through the 19th and 20th centuries. Spiritual Counterfeits Project editor Tal Brooke has compared the views of Proofs of a Conspiracy with those found in Carroll Quigley&#39;s Tragedy and Hope (Macmillan, 1966). Brooke suggests that the new world order, which Robison believed Adam Weishaupt (founder of the Illuminati) had in part accomplished through the infiltration of Freemasonry, will now be completed by those holding sway over the international banking system (e.g., by means of the Rothschilds&#39; banks, Federal Reserve, IMF, and World Bank).</p><h2>Nancy Wake: World War Two&#x2019;s Most Rebellious Spy</h2><p><p><b>&#x2018;Of all the variously talented women SOE sent to France, Nancy Wake was perhaps the most formidable&#x2019; &#x2014;Sebastian Faulks</b></p><p>This is the incredible true story of the greatest spy you&#x2019;ve never heard of&#x2014;as told to the author by the woman herself.</p><p>At the outbreak of World War Two, Nancy Wake&#x2019;s glamorous life in the South of France seemed far removed from the fighting.

So what really happens when this cult legend sticks out his thumb and faces the open road?

He lives in Baltimore, Maryland.</p><p>GOOD RIDE NUMBER ONE</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>HARRIS</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It&#x2019;s a beautiful Baltimore spring day&#x2014;the perfect 68o morning. I decide to leave twenty-four hours earlier than everyone in my office thinks I will, so I can avoid all their nervous goodbyes. Susan, my longtime assistant who runs my filth empire with an iron fist, has always thought this adventure a ludicrous idea but knows I am just as stubborn as she can be, so she long ago gave up on talking me out of it. Trish, my other full-time assistant, who will actually be transcribing this book (I write by hand on legal pads before she puts it on the computer), is a little friendlier to the idea since she was briefly a teenage runaway. Jill, my art helper, seems all for the idea. My bookkeeper, Doralee, has given up being surprised by anything that goes on in our office but knows I will continue to get a receipt for every single penny I spend while hitching, since no one could argue this is not a business trip. Margarett, my housekeeper, laughed the hardest I&#x2019;ve ever heard her (practically in my face) when I confessed my cross-country plans.</p> <p>Just before I walk out the front door to leave, I look out back and see the fox that lives on my property happily roaming my wooded grounds and take this as a good-luck sign. I turn on the burglar alarm and leave feeling&nbsp;&#x2026; well, adventurous. I walk up my small residential street and am relieved that none of my neighbors see me carrying a hitchhiking sign or question why I am on foot carrying an obvious travel bag. I get to the corner of Charles Street and stick out my thumb and hold up my I-70 WEST cardboard sign that Jill designed for me. &#x201c;Make the letters not <i>too</i> arty and certainly not STOP ME BEFORE I KILL AGAIN scary,&#x201d; I had mentioned, and she has followed instructions well. I don&#x2019;t feel ridiculous, I feel kind of brave.</p> <p>I can&#x2019;t believe it. The very first car that goes by stops, and I run to hop in. An art-school type dressed in brown jeans and an old Charles Theater T-shirt is behind the wheel of a car so nondescript that I have to ask him what kind it is. &#x201c;A very used 1999 VW Passat sedan,&#x201d; he answers in the kindest voice imaginable. I feel safe immediately. He doesn&#x2019;t even bat an eye that I&#x2019;m hitchhiking, even though he recognizes me. &#x201c;Wow, John Waters. I&#x2019;m a fan,&#x201d; he announces, low-key. He so respects my privacy he doesn&#x2019;t even ask where I&#x2019;m headed but offers, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going as far as West Virginia if that&#x2019;s a help.&#x201d; &#x201c;It sure is,&#x201d; I say, relieved I can avoid the tricky cloverleaf where I-70 West meets the Baltimore Beltway and there&#x2019;s nowhere to stand to bum a ride.</p> <p>&#x201c;Did you see Gaspar No�&#x2019;s <i>Enter the Void?</i>&#x201d; he asks with the excitement of a real film fanatic. &#x201c;Of course&#x2014;the best movie about taking drugs <i>ever!</i>&#x201d; I answer, so happy he wants to discuss other extreme pictures and not my own. &#x201c;I like the director&#x2019;s-cut version best,&#x201d; my driver continues, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s more endless, just like an LSD trip.&#x201d; &#x201c;I know Gaspar,&#x201d; I offer, &#x201c;and you&#x2019;d be surprised after seeing his films, but he&#x2019;s really a sweet guy.&#x201d; &#x201c;I love fucked-up movies,&#x201d; my fellow film buff enthuses as he turns up the radio, and what&#x2019;s playing? &#x201c;Hitch Hike&#x201d; by Marvin Gaye. Unbelievable!</p> <p>Is it me, or do I smell ganja? I&#x2019;m a little out of practice as a pothead. I used to smoke grass every day of my life around 1964 to 1972, but now only rarely because it just makes me worry about mundane things. But sometimes, in the summer in Provincetown on a Friday night when I have nothing to do the next day, I&#x2019;ll smoke a little weed and get &#x201c;launched,&#x201d; as my young friend and part-time pot smoker Frankie calls it when I start ranting and laughing while stoned. And of course I&#x2019;m a good host&#x2014;I have a small stash of pot in all my places of residence in case guests might want to smoke. Legal amounts. I hope.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Harris,&#x201d; he finally introduces himself, and I silently think, that&#x2019;s Divine&#x2019;s real first name, but keep it film-zealot friendly rather than Dreamland focused. Harris is a good-looking guy who seems laid-back, something I have never felt like in my entire life. I&#x2019;m thrilled my first ride is so seemingly uncomplicated. &#x201c;Are you a student at Maryland Institute?&#x201d; I ask, thinking college would be the perfect reason for him to be in Baltimore. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m in business for myself,&#x201d; he says with a sideways glance that invites all sorts of speculation as we merge onto the Baltimore Beltway headed in the right direction.</p> <p>&#x201c;Have you seen Armando B�&#x2019;s films?&#x201d; I ask, feeling as if continuing our movie-hound conversation is definitely part of my &#x201c;payment&#x201d; as a rider. &#x201c;I love his movies,&#x201d; Harris yells with enthusiasm as we head west on I-70, already on the first leg of my journey to San Francisco. &#x201c;Armando&#x2019;s been dead for many years now but he deserves to be honored more,&#x201d; I shout over the music, and my highway host agrees. &#x201c;That Isabel Sarli was <i>so</i> hot! Those tits were real, you know!&#x201d; he hollers in mammary mania about the director&#x2019;s onetime mistress and the star of all his films. &#x201c;<i>And</i> she&#x2019;s still alive!&#x201d; I shout. &#x201c;Seventy-five years old! I talked to her on the phone just recently,&#x201d; I brag, and I can tell he&#x2019;s impressed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding?&#x201d; Harris marvels in wide-eyed amazement. &#x201c;I really did,&#x201d; I answer, holding up my hand to silently swear to God. &#x201c;A South American trash-film enthusiast hooked us up, and although her English was a little rusty&#x2014;but way better than my Spanish&#x2014;I got to gush how much her films, like <i>Fury</i>, <i>Fever,</i> and <i>Fuego</i>, meant to both Divine and me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How come you aren&#x2019;t making a movie?&#x201d; Harris suddenly asks with shy concern. I explain I had a development deal to make <i>Fruitcake</i>, a &#x201c;terribly wonderful Christmas children&#x2019;s adventure,&#x201d; wrote the script, was about to make it, and then the recession happened, the independent film business as I knew it fell apart, and now all the distributors and film financiers want the budgets to be under $2 million, which I can&#x2019;t do anymore. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll back it,&#x201d; he says nonchalantly. &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; I sputter, not believing my ears. &#x201c;You can keep a secret, right?&#x201d; he whispers conspiratorially. &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I mumble, and I can, especially if it&#x2019;s a good one. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a pot dealer&nbsp;&#x2026; don&#x2019;t worry, there&#x2019;s none in the car, it&#x2019;s all on my West Virginia farm, but I&#x2019;ve got plenty of cash. How much do you need?&#x201d; &#x201c;Five million, give or take,&#x201d; I confide with a chuckle, sure Harris is pulling my leg. &#x201c;No problem,&#x201d; he says, beaming as if I had just asked him for spare change in Berkeley in the sixties. &#x201c;But surely you&#x2019;re not serious?&#x201d; I ask, thinking, how could this be possible? I&#x2019;ve been trying to raise this budget unsuccessfully for five years. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s no big deal,&#x201d; he says as we cross into West Virginia and I feel the thrill of illegal interstate financing. &#x201c;Maybe we could form a limited partnership like I used to do in the old days,&#x201d; I offer. &#x201c;Nah,&#x201d; he responds good-naturedly, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just give you the cash and you pay me back if it ever breaks even.&#x201d; <i>Cash?!</i> I think in alarm. Five million dollars in cash?! &#x201c;Good God, how will I ever explain this to the IRS?!&#x201d; I ask Harris in bewildered excitement. &#x201c;The Feds don&#x2019;t ask where you got it, do they?&#x201d; he replies levelheadedly. &#x201c;Just pay me back and I&#x2019;ll get the money laundered by a chain of nail salons I&#x2019;m a silent partner in.&#x201d; &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I say in shock, not wanting to blow the deal if he was possibly serious.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m so stunned by my new &#x201c;business partner&#x201d; that I don&#x2019;t even notice we&#x2019;ve exited the interstate and are now driving on a country road. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re near,&#x201d; Harris explains as he goes around the block a few times and zigzags back and forth on even smaller rural routes. I guess he&#x2019;s making sure we&#x2019;re not being followed, but I keep my newly green-lit mouth shut.</p> <p>Finally, we turn off on a beautiful dirt lane with a natural canopy of trees overhead and then veer off on an unmarked long driveway nestled in the hills of northern West Virginia and go about another half mile. Ahead of us is a lovingly restored but not overly yuppified 1850s farmhouse overlooking a pond with a waterfall gently cascading into it. Expansive trees and flowering plants surround the entire idyllic setting. His incredibly striking wife, barefoot already in May and dressed in a pair of fire-engine-red jeans and a long-sleeved black T-shirt, is watering the potted flowers on the outdoor patio.</p> <p>&#x201c;This is Laura,&#x201d; Harris introduces us, &#x201c;and of course you know John Waters and his films.&#x201d; She smiles a warm welcome and I can&#x2019;t help but notice she smells like pot, too. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to give him five million dollars to make his new film,&#x201d; he casually mentions, and she doesn&#x2019;t look particularly surprised. &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s sweet,&#x201d; Laura says, hardly looking up from the pot of black tulips (my favorite kind) she&#x2019;s just placed artfully on an outdoor table. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been looking to invest in films for such a long time,&#x201d; she offers happily. I grin but remain silent in stupefaction. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make us some lunch,&#x201d; offers Harris, before trotting off to the main farmhouse to prepare as Laura follows, eager to help.</p> <p>I just sit there in amazement at my good fortune. This is my first ride and already I&#x2019;m going to be back in the movie business. Harris and Laura soon return and we feast on delicious chicken salad made from free-range birds that Laura confides she strangled with her own hands just this morning. After a dessert of freshly picked blueberries, Harris carefully folds his cloth napkin (&#x201c;From Martick&#x2019;s,&#x201d; he proudly announces, a recently closed restaurant much loved by downtown-Baltimore bohemians) and says, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s take a walk, John.&#x201d; I eagerly follow him to a remote point of his property, and Harris reveals that we are now going &#x201c;to dig up the cash.&#x201d; I keep my mouth shut. &#x201c;Oh, honey,&#x201d; he yells to Laura, &#x201c;call up that FedEx place and make sure our buddy gets his lazy ass to work. Tell him we got a special shipment coming up.&#x201d;</p> <p>Harris turns to me and asks gently, &#x201c;Do you have a FedEx number? If not, we have a dummy one we can use.&#x201d; &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to FedEx the money?&#x201d; I ask in awe, amazed that Harris plans on giving me the money <i>now</i>! &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; he replies, &#x201c;you don&#x2019;t want to carry all that cash with you on your hitchhiking trip, do you?&#x201d; &#x201c;Well, no,&#x201d; I stammer, giving him the digits, which I know from memory. &#x201c;Great,&#x201d; he says, jotting down the account information, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ll FedEx it directly to your address.&#x201d; On cue, Laura walks like a gazelle down from the house, carrying a stack of flat FedEx boxes ready to be assembled. She has a lovely, serene smile on her lips. Maybe this is the first of their millions they&#x2019;re giving away. You can tell philanthropy brings her a new kind of delight.</p> <p>Harris grabs a shovel from behind the naturally distressed original barn door and leads me to an even more distant part of his farmland that appears to be overgrown with vines. &#x201c;Here,&#x201d; he announces as he pulls up several clods of phony earth covered in prop foliage and begins digging. Laura slips on a pair of rubber gloves. Harris hasn&#x2019;t even worked up a sweat before I hear the shovel clink on metal. &#x201c;Bingo,&#x201d; purrs Laura as she gives me a friendly wink. &#x201c;Pay dirt,&#x201d; jokes Harris as he begins to hoist up, with his thin but muscled arms, a small industrial safe with a combination lock. Laura hands me the first of the standard large FedEx boxes and gets out a pistol-grip tape dispenser. She quickly notices from my panicked expression that I have no idea how to assemble these boxes and gently takes the packaging back. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; she whispers gently, &#x201c;you deserve to be directing, not doing manual labor.&#x201d; Laura snaps the carton together in one swift motion and seals it with tape like Quick Draw McGraw and hands me back the box with the skill of a next-day-delivery artisan. Harris drops the safe to the ground and Laura swiftly dials the combination and I avert my eyes, hoping to not look greedy or, worse yet, sneaky. Harris moves to another spot of earth about thirty feet away, rips up more fake turf, and starts digging again. I hear him whistling &#x201c;There&#x2019;s No Business Like Show Business&#x201d; with surprising skill.</p> <p>&#x201c;Here you go,&#x201d; Laura says softly to me as she opens the safe door and hands me the first bundle of ten thousand $100 bills, which she assures me totals $1 million. It seems heavy to me but she scoffs mildly and says, &#x201c;It only weighs about twenty-five pounds. I&#x2019;ve had to carry $3 million strapped inside baggy winter clothes at customs, and believe me, that&#x2019;s a backbreaker, but I never complain. Helping keep Americans high is never easy or without toil.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s more cash!&#x201d; Harris cheerfully announces as he manually raises a duplicate safe from another &#x201c;grave&#x201d; in the ground and spins the combination lock like a safecracker supreme. &#x201c;This ought to pay for a lot of music rights,&#x201d; he chuckles happily to me, holding up the next million dollars in bills. &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t Johnny Knoxville like getting paid in cash?&#x201d; Laura asks with a kindness so rare in show business today. &#x201c;He sure will,&#x201d; I agree, impressed that she is so well-read on my career that she knows whom I want to star in my next film. How we&#x2019;ll handle Johnny&#x2019;s agent in an all-cash deal is something I&#x2019;ll figure out later.</p> <p>It takes about an hour more, but finally Harris and Laura have dug up three other little safes and unloaded all the do-re-mi into nine large FedEx boxes. I gather this is not putting much of a dent in their nontraditional banking practices. &#x201c;We trust you,&#x201d; says Harris warmly as he seals the last box. &#x201c;Yes, we do,&#x201d; adds Laura, with a criminal-capitalist inner peace I&#x2019;ll never forget. &#x201c;This is our small way of thanking you for all your films,&#x201d; she adds, &#x201c;and we know <i>Fruitcake</i> will be a hit.&#x201d; &#x201c;But don&#x2019;t change a thing in the script if you don&#x2019;t want to,&#x201d; Harris pipes in jovially. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t care if the film makes us our money back or not.&#x201d; &#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; announces Laura with excitement, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s time to get you up to the FedEx place. You&#x2019;ve got a hitchhiking trip to go on.&#x201d; &#x201c;And may all your rides be as prosperous as this first one,&#x201d; adds Harris with financial affection and artistic respect.</p> <p>I embrace my new non-note-giving movie producers, and Harris and I load all the boxes into the trunk of his vehicle. We get in and wave goodbye to Laura, who is already back to potting her perennials like a serenely demented garden-club enthusiast. Just as we pull off, a black butterfly lands on her shoulder in a Douglas Sirk way, and she returns the farewell gesture with a smile that would put Julia Roberts out of business.</p> <p>&#x201c;Did you see <i>Zoo</i>?&#x201d; Harris suddenly asks once we are on the road, eager to get back to cult-film talk. &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I answer with pride, &#x201c;that arty true-crime doc about the man who dies after getting fucked by a horse in Seattle. I toured presenting that film&#x2014;even showed it at the Sydney Opera House.&#x201d; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the one,&#x201d; Harris agrees. &#x201c;I felt for those guys who were involved,&#x201d; he reasons; &#x201c;it was a sad story but told in a dignified way. Did you believe that animal-rescue worker who when interviewed on film after the zoo guys had left the ranch said she &#x2018;saw a small pony come up and give a bigger horse a blow job&#x2019;? That was bullshit,&#x201d; Harris answers without missing a beat, knowing exactly the scene I was talking about. &#x201c;I like animals,&#x201d; he continues, &#x201c;but if that horse had a hard-on and did mount the guy, you can&#x2019;t call the sex act &#x2018;nonconsensual,&#x2019; can you? If an animal gets it up, isn&#x2019;t he willing?&#x201d;</p> <p>Before we can finish this debate we pull up to the FedEx drop-off store, amazingly subtitled on the sign out front GOING POSTAL. Harris informs me that this is the only &#x201c;corrupt&#x201d; FedEx office in the country and he is their only customer. That he does so much business here keeps it open and off the map of corporate concern.</p> <p>The clerk inside looks as if he just escaped from a Whole Foods em...</p></p><h2>The Light Over London</h2><p><b>Reminiscent of Martha Hall Kelly&#x2019;s <i>Lilac Girls</i> and Kristin Hannah&#x2019;s <i>The Nightingale</i>, this entrancing story &#x201c;is a poignant reminder that there is no limit to what women can do.

Antero Pietila shows how continued discrimination practices toward African Americans and Jews have shaped the cities in which we now live. Eugenics, racial thinking, and white supremacist attitudes influenced even the federal government&#39;s actions toward housing in the 20th century, dooming American cities to ghettoization. This all-American tale is told through the prism of Baltimore, from its early suburbanization in the 1880s to the consequences of &#34;white flight&#34; after World War II, and into the first decade of the twenty-first century. The events are real, and so are the heroes and villains. Mr. Pietila&#39;s engrossing story is an eye-opening journey into city blocks and neighborhoods, shady practices, and ruthless promoters.</p><p><b>Antero Pietila</b> spent thirty-five years as a reporter with the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, most of it covering the city's neighborhoods, politics, and government. A native of Finland, he became a student of racial change during his first visit to the United States in 1964. He lives in Baltimore.A sharply critical, exhaustively researched, and absolutely invaluable analysis, <i>Not In My Neighborhood</i> is the most important kind of history book-the history that must be studied so that its mistakes are not repeated (and so that solutions to difficult problems can be worked upon for the future)! Highly recommended. (<i>Midwest Book Review</i>)<br><br>...Spellbinding....The scope of Pietila's research over the past 130 years is dazzling (Jason Policastro <i>Baltimore Brew</i>)<br><br>With its sensitive subject, this groundbreaking book is a monumental effort.....Pietila hooks readers with anecdotes and arresting details. (Diane Scharper <i>Baltimore Sun</i>)<br><br>From suburbanization in the late 19th century to white flight after WWII and, more recently, the targeting of minorities with predatory sub-prime lending, the picture of Baltimore, once again, isn't pretty. (Steven Levingston <i>The Review of Higher Education</i>)<br><br><i> Not In My Neighborhood: How Bigotry Shaped A Great American City</i> offers a powerful survey of a Baltimore issue that shaped a city's psyche when discrimination policies toward blacks and Jews shaped a world....Eye-opening and recommended for any college-level social issues collection. (<i>Midwest Book Review, May 2010</i>)<br><br>Antero Pietila's sweeping and detailed portrait of Baltimore's 20th-century blockbusters is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand how and why the city came to look the way it does today. Morris Goldseker, the mighty Jack Pollack, &#x201c;Little Willie&#x201d; Adams, James Rouse, Joseph Meyerhoff, and even civil rights legends such as Juanita Mitchell all played their part&#x2015;and profited from&#x2015;Baltimore's racially rigged housing business. Clearly written, fast-paced, and filled with telling anecdotes, <i> Not in My Neighborhood </i> brings these players to vivid life, even if it merely nods to some of the larger, more impersonal forces that gave them their opportunities. (<i>Baltimore City Paper, December 2010</i>)<br><br>Former Baltimore Sun reporter Pietila, who covered Baltimore neighborhoods and politics for 35 years, has produced an engrossing chronicle that emphasizes the links between racism, real estate practices, and urban politics. Indeed, the author argues they have been inseparable in Baltimore&#x2015;and the nation. Pietila suggests that federal housing programs (1930s-60s) transformed the eugenics movement into national policy, and he significantly places realtors and developers at the very center of Baltimore politics. Most of the narrative focuses on the period 1910-68, although the author traces racial and real estate patterns back to the 1880s. The third section covers the 1960s and early 1970s....White versus black racism and black and white anti-Semitism are the main themes here, but Pietila's...account reveals class and religion added to already complex tensions. For instance, some Jewish developers would not rent or sell to Jewish families. Newspapers and personal interviews provide some colorful details. Secondary scholarship connects the Baltimore example to the national struggle over access to decent housing, driven by optimism, fear, and sometimes violence. Summing Up: Recommended. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>Not in My Neighborhood offers a lively, informative portrayal of how real estated practices throughout the twentieth century contributed to the segregated cities we see today.

That's why companies allocate their financial capital so carefully. But capital today is cheap and abundant, no longer a source of advantage. The truly scarce resources now are the time, the talent, and the energy of the people in your organization--resources that are too often squandered. There's plenty of advice about how to manage them, but most of it focuses on individual actions. What's really needed are <i>organizational</i> solutions that can unleash a company's full productive power and enable it to outpace competitors.</p><p>Building off of the popular <i>Harvard Business Review</i> article "Your Scarcest Resource," Michael Mankins and Eric Garton, Bain &amp; Company experts in organizational design and effectiveness, present new research into how you can liberate people's time, talent, and energy and unleash your organization's productive power. They identify the specific causes of <i>organizational drag</i>--the collection of institutional factors that slow things down, decrease output, and drain people's energy--and then offer a pragmatic framework for how managers can overcome it. With practical advice for using the framework and in-depth examples of how the best companies manage their people's time, talent, and energy with as much discipline as they do their financial capital, this book shows managers how to create a virtuous circle of high performance.</p></p><p><p><b>Michael Mankins</b> is a partner in Bain &amp; Company's San Francisco office and the former head of the firm's Organization practice in the Americas.

He leads the firm's global Organization practice and is a senior member of its Consumer Products and Industrial Goods &amp; Services practices.</p><p>"Employees spend too much time on useless meetings, emails and alerts. It kills organizations from within, and allows top talent to search for fresh pastures. Now they have done it again. Harvard Business Review Press and the consultants from Bain &amp; Company have come up with an excellent book.... that rises far above the others." -- <b><i>Borsen</i></b></p><p>"Most businesses get caught up in details that are important but not essential. That's where the book comes in. It helps leaders optimize their businesses at the most fundamental level." -- <b>Small Business Trends (smallbiztrends.com)</b></p><p>"<i>Time, Talent, Energy</i> hammers home the link between making better use of the hours at work and the Holy Grail of productivity. Mankins and Garton [point out] that time is just one component of human capital. Companies that effectively manage not just time but also their talent find themselves with the additional energy that is a crucial differentiator between them and their competitors...

But this actually happened in Elizabeth, New Jersey in the early 1950s, when beloved children&#x2019;s author Judy Blume (<em>Are You There God?

But in her novel <em>In the Unlikely Event</em>, which like <em>Summer Sisters</em> is written for an adult audience, Blume travels back to that time and tells the more intimate stories within the larger one, to help us better comprehend the incomprehensible, and learn the lessons that are the only bright side of catastrophe. And the overarching moral, here, is to not let fear limit your possibilities. Through the various characters that inhabit this multigenerational tale, Blume beseeches us to not be afraid to get on a plane, take career risks, pursue your dreams, fall in love...After all, life is made up of unlikely events, and they &#x201c;aren&#x2019;t all bad.

The short rhyming text makes it a perfect read-aloud treat, and with vivid illustrations from a breakout DreamWorks animator, readers and listeners alike will be thrilled to see what happens one night on Easy Street when a pair of cats start to groove to the beat.</p><p>Caroline Stutson was born in New York City.&nbsp;She earned&nbsp;her BA&nbsp;in theater from the University of Denver and her degree in early childhood education from Metropolitan State College in Denver. A former kindergarten and reading teacher, Ms. Stutson now lives in Littleton, Colorado, where she works as a&nbsp;puppeteer and storyteller at the Highlands Ranch Library.<br><br>Jon Klassen is a Canadian-born author-illustrator. He has written and illustrated the acclaimed Hat series, including <i>I Want My Hat Back</i>, <i>This Is Not My Hat</i>, and<i> We Found a Hat</i>. Highlights of his illustrated books are <i>Cats&#x2019; Night Out </i>by Caroline Stutson, <i>Sam &amp; Dave Dig A Hole </i>by Mac Barnett,<i> The Dark</i> by Lemony Snicket, and <i>The Wolf, The Duck &amp; The Mouse </i>also by Mac Barnett. His books have won a Caldecott medal and two Caldecott honors and other international awards. He lives in Los Angeles, California, with his wife and son.It&#x2019;s Saturday night on Easy Street, and this jazzy counting book reveals that the city&#x2019;s hot spots are its rooftops, fire escapes, and alleyways, where pairs of cool kitties dance the night away. As music rises into the night air, 2 cats samba in white, while nearby 4 more felines boogie in saddle shoes and poodle skirts, and still 6 more tango in capes on fire escapes. Their numbers increase, until finally, when 20 hep cats conga on clotheslines, the neighbors revolt. Stutson&#x2019;s syncopated rhymes sport fun flourishes of dance and fashion vocabulary (&#x201c;Twelve town tabbies do the twist, / swinging their hips in dotted Swiss&#x201d;) and a catchy refrain, but it&#x2019;s Klassen&#x2019;s atmospheric, retro illustrations that take the lead. The stellar digitally rendered illustrations in a muted gray and brown palette may resonate more with urban sophisticates than children learning their numbers, but the detailed cityscapes, hidden numbers, and appealing big-city cats will give little ones plenty to explore.

Americans, especially now, confront serious questions and evidences that our capitalist system is in trouble. It clearly serves the 1% far, far better than what it is doing to the vast mass of the people. Marx was a social critic for whom capitalism was not the end of human history. It was just the latest phase and badly needed the transition to something better. We offer this essay now because of the power and usefulness today of Marx&#39;s criticism of the capitalist economic system. eBook: https://bit.ly/2K6iI8v</p><p></p><h2>The Mystery of the Mixed-up Zoo (The Boxcar Children, No. 26)</h2><p>The Boxcar Children try to find out who&#39;s responsible for causing some trouble at Edward Marlow&#39;s zoo.</p><p>Gertrude Chandler Warner was born in 1890 in Putnam, Connecticut, where she taught school and wrote The Boxcar Children because she had often imagined how delightful it would be to live in a caboose or freight car. Encouraged by the book&#39;s success, she went on to write eighteen more stories about the Alden children.</p><h2>Promoting Executive Function in the Classroom (What Works for Special-Needs Learners)</h2><p><p>Accessible and practical, this book helps teachers incorporate executive function processes&#x2014;such as planning, organizing, prioritizing, and self-checking&#x2014;into the classroom curriculum. Chapters provide effective strategies for optimizing what K&#x2013;12 students learn by improving <i>how</i> they learn. Noted authority Lynn Meltzer and her research associates present a wealth of easy-to-implement assessment tools, teaching techniques and activities, and planning aids. Featuring numerous whole-class ideas and suggestions, the book also shows how to differentiate instruction for students with learning or attention difficulties. Case examples illustrate individualized teaching strategies and classroom accommodations. More than a dozen reproducibles are included; the large-size format facilitates photocopying and day-to-day reference. Purchasers also get access to a Web page where they can download and print the reproducible materials.<br><br> See also Meltzer's edited volume, <i>Executive Function in Education, Second Edition,</i> which presents state-of-the-art knowledge on the role of EF in learning across the content areas.</p></p><p><p>Lynn Meltzer, PhD, is President and Director of the Institutes for Learning and Development (ResearchILD and ILD) in Lexington, Massachusetts.

Meltzer shares tested strategies and abundant classroom examples. She provides necessary tools for supporting academic growth in a wide range of students, and for helping students experience the critical truth that informed effort is the key to success. This book really gets the job done!"--Carol Ann Tomlinson, EdD, William Clay Parrish, Jr. Professor and Chair, Department of Educational Leadership, Foundations, and Policy, University of Virginia&nbsp;"This book succeeds very well in its goal of providing usable information for teachers and other school professionals. The chapters are well written, informative, clear, and practical. The case studies and numerous case examples are excellent. These human touches help to illustrate the many areas of executive functioning that can be supported and enhanced for children with disabilities as well as typically developing children. This book will be an invaluable reference for any school or clinical personnel."--Margaret Semrud-Clikeman, PhD, ABPdN, Division Director, Clinical Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Minnesota Medical School&nbsp;"An excellent, detailed overview of how executive functions can be integrated into classroom instruction for all grade levels. The book is very teacher friendly, including many examples and useable forms and techniques. A major appeal of the book is its focus on creating a classroom culture that fosters executive function for all students, rather than just presenting remediation techniques for those having difficulties. The strategies for screening and ongoing assessment mean that the book can easily be used as part of a schoolwide response-to-intervention or positive behavioral support system. Each chapter follows the same format, explaining first why the area is important, and then how to implement instruction at elementary, middle, and high school levels."--Catherine A. Fiorello, PhD, School Psychology Program, Temple University&nbsp;"Teachers will find this book enormously useful, easy to understand, and easy to implement. Each chapter includes a remarkable array of rubrics, templates, checklists, and examples. The book looks strategically at the role of executive function (EF) in teaching and learning, showing how EF deficits can be impediments to academic, personal, and social success. By creating a culture of EF, teachers and administrators can support the growth of self-aware, resilient, problem-solving students who are ready to take on the challenges of learning, in school and beyond."--Lou Salza, MEd, Headmaster, Lawrence School, Broadview Heights, Ohio</p><h2>The Nitric Oxide (NO) Solution</h2><p><b>Product Description</b> Eighty-one million Americans have cardiovascular disease, the arterial damage that leads to the heart attacks and strokes that account for 36 percent of all deaths in the U.S. But few people know that by boosting the body&#x2019;s levels of a single molecule&#x2015;nitric oxide (NO)&#x2015;you can help prevent, control and even reverse cardiovascular disease.<p> In this groundbreaking book, nitric oxide expert Nathan Bryan, PhD, and natural healer Janet Zand, OMD, tell you all about nitric oxide, the &#x201c;miracle molecule&#x201d; that can dramatically improve your health.

He explores the lives of individuals like African American scientist George Washington Carver, who specialized in crop diseases caused by fungi; Beatrix Potter, creator of <i>Peter Rabbit</i>, who was prevented from becoming a professional mycologist because she was a woman; and Gordon Wasson, a J. P. Morgan vice-president who almost single-handedly introduced the world to magic mushrooms. Millman considers why fungi are among the most significant organisms on our planet and how they are currently being affected by destructive human behavior, including climate change.</p><p>With charming drawings by artist and illustrator Amy Jean Porter, <i>Fungipedia</i> offers a treasure trove of scientific and cultural information.

Without a doubt this is a must-have for any Raiders fan.</b><br><br>It&#x2019;s almost impossible to talk about Oakland football without bringing up the name of the consummate Raider, Tom Flores. Legendary for both his skills on the field and his coaching guidance from the sideline, Flores has been an integral part of the Raiders organization since its inception in 1960.<br><br>Now Flores shares the greatest stories and anecdotes from his time with the team in the newly updated edition of <i>Tales from the Oakland Raiders Sideline</i>.

Wild edibles collected by professional foragers are proliferating on the plates of top-tier restaurants because they offer novel and ultra-fresh sensations for the tongue, and they frequently taste more flavorful than farmed foods. For people seeking new food experiences and wanting to forage for themselves, <i>Idiot&#x2019;s Guides<i>�</i>: Foraging</i> shows how to find wild edibles and when and how to harvest them. Includes 30+ tasty recipes that describe how to prepare these wild foods.<br><br> * Includes common plants all across North America.<br> * Covers positive plant identification.<br> * Multiple large, full-color photos identify each plant (including the mature plant, how it looks at various stages of growth, and how it looks at the right stage of growth for harvesting).<br> * Each entry gives facts on the plant's habitat, physical properties, which parts are edible, harvesting sustainability, preparation, storage, and poisonous look-alikes.<br> * More than 30 delicious recipes.<br> * Includes range maps and charts that list plants by habitat and by season.</p><p><b>Mark Vorderbruggen </b>started one of the top foraging sites on the internet in 2008, but he has been a forager all his life. Both his parents' families used foraged foods to survive during the Great Depression, and they passed their knowledge on to him. Knowing how to harvest nature's free food fed him through the poverty years of his childhood and while getting a master's degree in medicinal chemistry and a PhD in physical organic chemistry. For the last 18 years, he has worked as a research chemist in the oil industry, using his knowledge of natural products to develop environmentally friendly replacements for traditional oil field chemicals. However, his evenings and weekends are spent guiding people back to nature's bounty, not only teaching them which plants are edible and/or medicinal, but also proselytizing how foraging heals the body, mind, and soul ... and prepares them for the zombie apocalypse!</p><h2>Shaping the Prayers of the People: The Art of Intercession</h2><p>This book offers a model of profound and accessible congregational prayer. At once inspirational and practical, it will empower and equip laypeople and clergy alike to offer heartfelt, informed, and appropriate prayers on behalf of the people of God. As Samuel Wells and Abigail Kocher say, "Interceding in public worship is a duty. This book is intended to make it a joy."<br><br><i>Shaping the Prayers of the People</i> begins by considering what public prayer is and offering practical guidelines for avoiding common pitfalls. It explores prayer as an integral part of worship and discusses the language we need (and don't need) to address God. Significantly, the book also provides an array of example prayers along with commentary.</p><p>Samuel Wells, formerly Dean of Duke Chapel, is now Vicarof St. Martin-in-the-Fields, Trafalgar Square, and VisitingProfessor of Christian Ethics at King&#39;s College London. Hisprevious books include Be Not Afraid: Facing Fear withFaith and Power and Passion: Six Characters inSearch of Resurrection.<b><i>Anglican Theological Review</i></b><br> "Clergy and laity alike will find this slim volume useful."<br><br><b>Thomas G. Long</b><br> &#x2014;Candler School of Theology<br> "At a time when much prayer in worship is actually something less than prayer - an elongation of the sermon, an 'infomercial' for God, or even the parish announcements spoken in hushed tones - Samuel Wells and Abigail Kocher have given us this fine book on public prayer that is really prayer. They teach us how to fashion intercessions that are faithful, careful, creative, and beautiful. Every worship leader needs to read this volume."<br><br><b>Eugene H. Peterson</b><br> &#x2014;Regent College<br> "In our American culture where prayer is relentlessly individualized, Wells and Kocher gather us into a community understood comprehensively &#x2014; public worship that takes seriously and devoutly both congregation and world. They pull us out of our private isolation into something large where God is working largely &#x2014; and all of this written in prose that is both accurate and alive."<br><br><b>William H. Willimon</b><br> &#x2014;Duke Divinity School<br> "We do not become or remain Christian without the practice of prayer. . . . In joining Christ in his intercession for the world we boldly expose our needs and the world's hurt to the will of God. We demonstrate our faith that God not only cares but acts; we rise up against injustice and dare to stand at the intersection of human need and divine compassion. Wells and Kocher are faithful guides through the risky practice of intercessory prayer. Their book gets to the heart of the Christian faith in its bold claim that as we shape our prayers, our prayers shape us. Here is a very helpful, practical, vibrantly theological book."<br><br><b>Walter Brueggemann</b><br> &#x2014;Columbia Theological Seminary<br> "This compelling study will be of immense importance to anyone who must pray in public. Wells and Kocher connect faith claims to life by attention to crafted, lyrical rhetoric &#x2014; a powerful antidote to too much public prayer that is domesticated, predictable, and rote."<br><br><b>John D. Witvliet</b><br> &#x2014;Calvin Institute of Christian Worship<br> "In the past generation, congregations have given renewed attention to many aspects of worship &#x2014; preaching, music, the Lord's supper, and visual arts and media. Public prayer is, in too many cases, a notable exception. This wise and winsome volume promises to remedy that, leading congregations to become more intentional and faithful in shaping prayers that aspire to match the breadth and depth of God's redemptive activity."<br><br><b><i>Worship Leader</i></b><br> "For all who want to understand and implement prayer in the church, this is a significant resource. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wells and Kocher ignite our imagination and infuse our hearts with joy at the idea of intercessory prayer, replacing what for many worshipers is confusion and/or a sense of unenthusiastic duty. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Add this to your collection of lifelong keepers."<br><br><b><i>Presbyterian Outlook</i></b><br> "Few things are worse than rants disguised as prayers or homiletic postscripts sneakily added to the pastoral prayer or political posturing with heads bowed. The authors, both of whom regularly lead worship, guide readers away from such common errors. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Here is theology carefully and practically laid out in ways that will deepen the congregations who are blessed by leaders who pray well."<br><br><b><i>CBA Retailers &amp; Resources</i></b><br> "Recommend to prayer leaders and pastors."<br><br><b><i>Sharing the Practice</i></b><br> "This book is a marvelous tool for the pastor or worship leader to examine his/her approach to public prayers and discover ways to enrich and refine the art of public praying. It shows the importance of careful preparation and the appropriate focus for public prayers. . . . Any minister who desires to improve his or her public prayers will find in this book a pathway to public prayer that can be transforming."</p><h2>Jim Harrison: The Essential Poems</h2><p>"An untrammeled renegade genius... Here is a poet talking to you instead of around himself, while doing absolutely brilliant and outrageous things with language."&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br><b>Starred Review in <i>Booklist</i></b>: &#x201c;[C]hoices of poems from each of Harrison&#x2019;s books are passionate and sharp... Of special note is a section from <i>Letters to Yesenin</i>, a book-length poem, and the title poem from <i>The Theory and Practice of Rivers </i>, which contains these echoing lines, 'I forgot where I heard that poems / are designed to waken sleeping gods.' Reading this essential volume, one might imagine that the gods are, indeed, staying up late, reading lights on, turning the pages.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Jim Harrison: The Essential Poems</i> is distilled from fourteen volumes--from visionary lyrics and meditative suites to shape-shifting ghazals and prose-poem letters. Teeming throughout these pages are Harrison&#x2019;s legendary passions and appetites, his meditations, rages, and love-songs to the natural world. <i>The New York Times</i> concluded a review from early in Harrison&#x2019;s career with a provocative quote: &#x201c;This is poetry worth loving, hating, and fighting over, a subjective mirror of our American days and needs.&#x201d; That sentiment still holds true, as Jim Harrison&#x2019;s essential poems continue to call for our fiercest attention.<br><br>Also included are full-color images of poem drafts--both typescripts and holographs--as well as the letter Denise Levertov sent to publisher W.W. Norton in the early 1960s, advocating for Harrison's debut collection.<br><br>In his essay "Poetry as Survival," Jim Harrison wrote, "Poetry, at its best, is the language your soul would speak if you could teach your soul to speak." <i>The Essential Poems</i> is proof positive that Jim Harrison taught his soul to speak. <br><br>"In this unforgiving literary moment, we must deal honestly with [Harrison's] life and work, as they are inextricable in a way that is not true of other poets...These poems bear-crawl gorgeously after a genuine connection to being, thrashing in giant leaps through the underbrush to find consolation, purpose, and redemption. In his raw, original keening he ambushes moments of unimaginable beauty, one after another, line after line...<i>The Essential Poems</i> demonstrates perfectly why we should turn to Harrison again. He lived and breathed an American confrontation with the physical earth, married himself to a universe of bodies and stumps and birds, did not try to shuck his grotesque masculinity and stared hard with his one good eye (the left was blinded when he was seven) at the inescapable, beckoning finger of death." &#x2015;Dean Kuipers, <i>LitHub</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Essential Poems</i> provides a good introduction&#x2015;or reintroduction&#x2015;to the work of this singular writer... these pieces illustrate Harrison&#x2019;s range and his ease with various formats, from lyric poems to meditative suites to prose poems. They also spotlight his deep, rugged kinship with rural landscapes and the natural world, where &#x2018;the cost of flight is landing.&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>"Jim Harrison's latest collection, <i>The Essential Poems</i>, contains...engaging and enlightening poems [that] should be taught, learned, and loved. Remember this."&#x2015;<i>New York Journal of Books</i><br><br>"Had he been a chef, all the other foodies would have talked about how Jim Harrison dealt with big flavors. In his poems, they&#x2019;re all there &#x2015; love and death, remorse and longing, the rocket contrails of living. There&#x2019;s not a lot of small talk in <i>The Essential Poems</i>... this book grabs you by the collar and tells you in eleven hundred ways to wake up."&#x2015;John Freeman, Executive Editor, "Recommended Reading from Lit Hub Staff" <br><br>"It is hard-boiled poetry, some of the best of its kind, and one is not surprised to know that Harrison has written very tough novels... His poetic vision is at the heart of it all."&#x2015;<i>Harper's</i></p><p>Jim Harrison (1937-2016) was the author of over three dozen books, including Legends of the Fall and Dalva, <br>and served as the food columnist for the magazines Brick and Esquire. He published fourteen volumes of poetry, the final being Dead Man's Float (2016). His work has been translated into two dozen languages and produced as four feature-length films. As a young poet he co-edited Sumac magazine, with fellow poet Dan Gerber, and earned a National Endowment for the Arts grant and a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 2007, he was elected into the Academy of American Arts and Letters. Regarding his most beloved art-form, he wrote: "Poetry, at its best, is the language your soul would speak if you could teach your soul to speak." Jim Harrison certainly spoke the language.3<br>I wanted to feel exalted so I picked up<br>Dr. Zhivago again.

People make judgments about it every day. Yet articulating a clear definition of quality is challenging.<br>The best companies often appear to be characterized by an ineffable something, much like that of people who seem graced by a lucky gene. Think about those of your peers who seem a lot like you but somehow always catch a break. They are not obviously smarter, smoother, richer, or better-looking than you, yet they are admitted to their university of choice, get their dream job, and earn considerable wealth. Try to discern what they have that you don&#x2019;t, and you are stumped. Chalk it up to fate or plain dumb luck.<br>Businesses can be similar. For reasons that are not always evident, some end up doing the right things with better results than average. They may not appear to be savvier acquirers, more adept marketers, or bolder pioneers, yet they integrate new businesses better, launch products more successfully, and open new markets with fewer mishaps. Perhaps through some combination of vision, scale, or business philosophy, these companies uncannily come out ahead.<br>In our view, three characteristics indicate quality. These are strong, predictable cash generation; sustainably high returns on capital; and attractive growth opportunities.</p><p>"Investing is a continuous process of learning, and it will be a rare investor who does not glean substantive lessons from the notable AKO story of quality investing.";- <strong>Stephen Blyth, President and CEO, Harvard Management Company, Professor of the Practice of Statistics, Harvard University;</strong><br><br>"Capturing both the science and the art that have driven AKO's success, Quality Investing is equal parts investing handbook and ode to the beauty of truly great businesses."; <strong>Peter H.

Nothing ever would be again. And besides, I didn&#x2019;t want a home&#x2014;the word came with memories too painful to think about.<br> <br>I knew my aunt Coralee and uncle Boone were watching me closely as they led me through the house. They wanted me to like it here&#x2014;there was a certain hopefulness in their eyes. I didn&#x2019;t remember what hope felt like. It had been so long since I&#x2019;d hoped for anything. <br> <br>&#x201c;We gave you a room upstairs. I painted it a pretty �cotton-candy blue,&#x201d; Aunt Coralee informed me �cautiously. &#x201c;I remembered that you liked blue.&#x201d; <br> <br>It&#x2019;s true that I had liked blue a few Christmases ago. Had even worn all blue one year. I wasn&#x2019;t necessarily a fan of it now, though.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>I followed both my aunt and uncle up the stairs. The family photos lining the wall made me turn my head back around and stare straight ahead. I&#x2019;d had those once too. Photos that my mother proudly displayed on the walls of our home. But those photos had been lies. The smiles were never real. <br> <br>&#x201c;Here it is,&#x201d; Aunt Coralee announced as she stopped halfway down the hall and opened the door to a large bedroom. Other than the blue walls, everything else was white. <br> <br>I liked it. If I weren&#x2019;t afraid of my own voice, I&#x2019;d tell her thank you. Instead I put down the backpack from my shoulders then turned and hugged her. That would have to be enough. <br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I certainly hope you like my room,&#x201d; a deep voice drawled from the doorway. <br> <br>&#x201c;Brady, don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Uncle Boone said in a stern voice. <br> <br>&#x201c;What? I was just being nice,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Kinda&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>I only remembered my cousin Brady a little. He had never played with me at family events, was always running off with one of the buddies he&#x2019;d brought with him. <br> <br>Now he was leaning against the doorframe of the bedroom, brown hair falling into his eyes, a smirk on his face. He didn&#x2019;t seem happy. Oh God, had they given me his room? That couldn&#x2019;t be good. I didn&#x2019;t want to take his room. <br> <br>&#x201c;Brady&#x2019;s just being a brat,&#x201d; Aunt Coralee explained quickly. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s perfectly happy about moving to the attic room. He&#x2019;s been at us for two years to fix up that space for him so he&#x2019;d have somewhere more private.&#x201d; <br> <br>A large hand landed on my shoulder as Uncle Boone came to stand beside me. &#x201c;Son, you remember Maggie,&#x201d; he said in a voice that didn&#x2019;t leave room for argument. <br> <br>Brady was staring at me. He looked annoyed at first, but his expression suddenly softened into something resembling concern. &#x201c;Yeah, I remember her.&#x201d; <br> <br>Uncle Boone continued, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll need to show her around at school on Monday. Y&#x2019;all are in the same grade, and we made sure they put her in several of your classes so you could help her out.&#x201d; I had a feeling Brady already knew all this. The information was for me. <br> <br>Brady sighed and shook his head. &#x201c;Y&#x2019;all don&#x2019;t even know,&#x201d; he muttered before walking off. <br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry about him,&#x201d; Aunt Coralee said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s become so moody, and we don&#x2019;t know what to do with him half the time.&#x201d; <br> <br>Even if I did speak, I didn&#x2019;t have a response for that.<br> <br>She squeezed my arm. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re gonna let you get settled in. Unpack, and rest if you need. If you want company, I&#x2019;ll be in the kitchen, cooking dinner. You&#x2019;re welcome to go anywhere in the house you&#x2019;d like. Make yourself at home.&#x201d; <br> <br>There was that word again: home. <br> <br>My aunt and uncle left me alone, finally, and retreated down the hall. I stood in the pretty blue room and realized, much to my surprise, that I already felt safe. I&#x2019;d thought the comfort of safety was long gone for me. <br> <br>&#x201c;So, you really don&#x2019;t talk?&#x201d; Brady&#x2019;s voice filled the room, and I spun around to see my cousin back in the doorway. <br> <br>I really didn&#x2019;t want him to dislike me or be annoyed about my being here. But I wasn&#x2019;t sure how to convince him that I&#x2019;d keep to myself, that I wouldn&#x2019;t bother him or change his life. <br> <br>&#x201c;Shit, this ain&#x2019;t gonna be easy. You&#x2019;re&#x2014;&#x201d; He paused and let out a laugh that didn&#x2019;t sound like he meant it. &#x201c;This shit is gonna be worse than I thought. Least you could have helped me out and been ugly.&#x201d; <br> <br>Excuse me? <br> <br>Brady frowned. &#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t draw attention to yourself. My momma finally got the daughter she never had, but it don&#x2019;t make shit easier for me. I have a life, you know.&#x201d; <br> <br>I simply nodded. I was sure he had a life. He was tall with dark hair and light hazel eyes, and his wide shoulders hinted at the muscles underneath his T-shirt. No doubt girls loved him. <br> <br>I had no intention of being in his way, but I could see how my coming into his home and taking his room would make it seem otherwise. And now his parents had me in his classes, too. <br> <br>But I&#x2019;d prove he had nothing to worry about. I picked up my backpack again and took out the pad and pen I always kept with me. <br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;re you doing?&#x201d; he asked, clearly confused. <br> <br>I quickly wrote:<br> <br>Promise I won&#x2019;t be in your way. Don&#x2019;t expect you to help me at school. Just let your parents think you are, and I&#x2019;ll go along with it. Sorry I took your room. We can switch back if you want.<br> <br>I handed the note pad to Brady and let him read it. When he finished, he sighed deeply and handed the pad back to me. <br> <br>&#x201c;You can keep the room. Mom&#x2019;s right. I like the attic. I was just being an ass. You think you won&#x2019;t need me at school, but you will. Can&#x2019;t be helped.&#x201d; And with that, he walked away. <br> <br>I stood at the doorway as he made his way down to the kitchen. I started to shut the door when I heard Brady&#x2019;s voice travel up the stairs. <br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s for dinner?&#x201d; he asked. <br> <br>&#x201c;Chicken spaghetti. I thought Maggie might like it since it&#x2019;s your favorite,&#x201d; Aunt Coralee replied. Then, dropping her voice a little: &#x201c;I wish you&#x2019;d take the time to get to know her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just talked to her. She, uh, wrote to me,&#x201d; he replied. <br> <br>&#x201c;And? Ain&#x2019;t she sweet?&#x201d; Aunt Coralee sounded so sincere. <br> <br>&#x201c;Sure, Mom. She&#x2019;s real sweet.&#x201d; <br> <br>But Brady didn&#x2019;t sound very convinced.</p><h2>The Jesus I Never Knew Study Guide</h2><p>Voted Book of the Year Philip Yancey&#x2019;s bestselling book The Jesus I Never Knew peeled away popular stereotypes to present a brilliant and fascinating portrait of Christ.

But this year is different. Small things are disappearing, then some of the presents themselves. Treva is mystified, until early one morning she sees a small creature scurrying across the snow, carrying the Christmas pudding. Treva races after it into the forest where her adventures are just beginning. . .<br><br><i>Christmas Trolls </i> is a glorious celebration of the season as Treva confronts two irresistible trolls who don't understand Christmas. Jan Brett's exquisite paintings set against beautiful, intricate borders give readers a magical Christmas full of surprises.<br><br>(Look closely at the borders for glimpses of the trolls' special little helper -- and he's not an elf!)</p><p>With over thirty four million books in print, Jan Brett is one of the nation's foremost author illustrators of children's books. Jan lives in a seacoast town in Massachusetts, close to where she grew up. During the summer her family moves to a home in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts.<p>As a child, Jan Brett decided to be an illustrator and spent many hours reading and drawing. She says, "I remember the special quiet of rainy days when I felt that I could enter the pages of my beautiful picture books. Now I try to recreate that feeling of believing that the imaginary place I'm drawing really exists. The detail in my work helps to convince me, and I hope others as well, that such places might be real."</p><p>As a student at the Boston Museum School, she spent hours in the Museum of Fine Arts. "It was overwhelming to see the room-size landscapes and towering stone sculptures, and then moments later to refocus on delicately embroidered kimonos and ancient porcelain," she says. "I'm delighted and surprised when fragments of these beautiful images come back to me in my painting."</p><p>Travel is also a constant inspiration. Together with her husband, Joe Hearne, who is a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Jan visits many different countries where she researches the architecture and costumes that appear in her work. "From cave paintings to Norwegian sleighs, to Japanese gardens, I study the traditions of the many countries I visit and use them as a starting point for my children's books."</p>Blond, blue-eyed Treva (The Trouble with Trolls, 1992) teaches a pair of greedy little trolls how to celebrate Christmas: following them in order to find the gifts and ornaments they've snitched from her house, she helps them decorate their home, shows them how to share, and offers them a gift--a gesture they make in return on Christmas morning. The story is predictable but related with appealing directness; and fans will be enchanted, once again, with the lovingly detailed folk/Scandinavian details in Brett's bright, crisply delineated art, especially in the intriguing borders--where the trolls' charming pet hedgehogs are busy with their own related pursuits.

Here, she meets and falls for Charlie Connally, the eldest of the four Irish-Catholic boys next door. But all hopes for a future together are soon throttled by the war and a tragedy that hits much closer to home.&nbsp;<br><br>Grief-stricken, Addie flees&#x2014;first to Washington and then to war-torn London&#x2014;and finds a position at a prestigious newspaper, as well as a chance to redeem lost time, lost family...and lost love.

And in a final, fateful choice, Addie discovers that the way home may be a path she never suspected.</p><p>Pam Jenoff is the author of several books of historical fiction, including the NYT bestseller The Orphan&#39;s Tale. She holds a degree in international affairs from George Washington University and a degree in history from Cambridge, and she received her JD from UPenn. Her novels are inspired by her experiences working at the Pentagon and as a diplomat for the State Department handling Holocaust issues in Poland. She lives with her husband and 3 children near Philadelphia, where she teaches law.<em>Washington, DC <br>November 1943</em><br><br>I did not fight the umbrella which blew inside out as I stepped from the streetcar. Instead, I clung tighter to my nearly soaked cloche to hold it in place against the icy rain that slanted sideways across Pennsylvania Avenue. Navigating the slick pavement carefully, I swam through the midafternoon crowd, mostly women and a few men too old or broken for service, who were waiting in line at the Red Cross canteen truck for coffee, or making their way between government buildings and the makeshift tent offices that lined the Mall.<br><br>Brushing the raindrops from my overcoat, I slid under the awning that shielded the security booth outside the Department of State Building, pausing to fumble for my press pass. The guard eyed me incredulously as he scrutinized my credentials. Ignoring him, I gazed up at the White House, pale against the stormy gray clouds. Something moved on the roof above, the swivel of an anti-aircraft gun pointed upward. My heart skipped. Washington was a city occupied not just by the thousands who had come here to work, but by the army that defended it as though the Germans might at any moment descend from the sky.<br><br>Lowering my eyes, I caught a wistful glimpse of my disheveled reflection in the window of the guard booth. I'd left the rooming house in good form to a sky that, if not sunny, had certainly not suggested this downpour. Arriving at the <em>Post,</em> I expected a day like most I'd had these past few months, typing stories from shorthand notes on a Remington at a desk barely wide enough to hold it, pressed close to a dozen other girls. I didn't mind; I needed work and I was grateful that my high school secretarial course had qualified me for it. Though it would have paid a few dollars more, I had dreaded the prospect of working as one of the government girls at the War Department. I couldn't bear to endlessly type letters telling families that their sons were not coming home, seeing Charlie's face in each of them.<br><br>During my first few months at the news bureau, the work had been quiet and predictable. But one afternoon nearly two weeks ago, a man with his sleeves rolled up had opened the door to the steno pool. "Italian?" he bellowed. A cloud of cigarette smoke appeared before him as he exhaled, making him seem a gray-haired dragon. The room fell silent. Chip Steeves, managing editor of the <em>Washington Post,</em> never came into the typing room. "My secretary is out and I need someone to call a translator." Impulsively, I raised my hand. Then I looked around. I was the only one and I started to lower it.<br><br>But Mr. Steeves was already weaving his way through the desks, descending upon me. "You can find me someone to translate Italian?" He spoke through the cigar stub clenched between his teeth.<br><br>"No." I looked at him squarely. "I can do it myself."<br><br>He eyed me for several seconds, his face a scowl. "Well, come on," he barked impatiently, as though I, and not he, had hesitated. I could feel the eyes of the other typists on me as I walked from the room.<br><br>"Montforte, isn't it?" he asked, surprising me as we entered his office. The desk was covered in piles of papers, the floor littered with dirty coffee cups.<br><br>"Yes." I cleared my throat. "Addie, that is Adelia."<br><br>He didn't introduce himself; he didn't need to. Chip Steeves was legendary as journalist and terror. "You're the girl who caught that mistake in the U-boat story." I straightened slightly. My job was only to type articles, not proofread them. I had seen an error in one of the stories, though, a date that I knew from my own reading was wrong. I had pointed it out to Mr. Steeves's secretary, who oversaw the typists. But I did not know that the message had been passed on&#x2014;or that I had received credit. "That was good work. You speak Italian?"<br><br>"Yes. I was born in Trieste." Being foreign-born was not something that one announced loudly these days, and I'd worked hard to remove all trace of an accent. This might be the first time it was an asset.<br><br>He thrust out a pen as if he might hit me with it, and I fought the urge to cower. "Well, translate this, Adelia Montforte." I took the paper he offered and moved an overflowing ashtray from the nearest chair, then perched on it and scrawled the translation hurriedly. It was a cable about a skirmish that had taken place near Salerno, brief but with a few military terms I wasn't quite sure I'd gotten right.<br><br>When I finished, I handed it back to Mr. Steeves, who scanned the page. "This is good."<br><br>"I could do better with more time," I offered.<br><br>"Couldn't we all? But you don't botch the feel of it, like the real translators do."<br><br>After that, Mr. Steeves sent more translation work my way through his secretary. But he had not reappeared himself&#x2014;until this morning. "Montforte," he hollered as he stuck his head into the steno pool, causing me to jump. I'd leapt up and grabbed my pen and pad, assuming it was another translation job. But when I started for the door of his office, he waved me away. "Be at the State Department this afternoon at three."<br><br>I stared at him blankly. "Me? But why?" He tossed me a press pass and disappeared into his office.<br><br>The guard handed back my pass now, along with a visitor's badge, which I pinned to the collar of my blouse. I stepped uncertainly into the massive lobby of the State Building, marveling at the high chandelier, better suited to a ballroom. But before I could take it all in, Mr. Steeves appeared, grabbing me by the arm. He led me unceremoniously past a marble staircase, down a corridor and into a room with a long oak conference table. "The deputy secretary has called a meeting with the press to talk about our coverage of our allies, making sure it doesn't hurt the war effort, that sort of thing."<br><br>"I don't understand. Isn't there something you need me to translate?"<br><br>He shook his head. "Nah, kid. My cub reporter's been called up so I need someone to help me cover the meeting. You were the best one for the job."<br><br>"The best one? I'm a typist. I can't possibly cover a story."<br><br>"Just take one of the chairs against the wall and take notes. And don't say anything," he instructed, then disappeared into a group of uniformed men clustered in the corner.<br><br>I took off my overcoat and folded it in the lap of my navy blue skirt, noticing as I sat down a run in my nylons. Then I tried to smooth the wrinkles from my pleated-front blouse. I was the only woman in the room, except for the one setting out coffee cups. The war might have brought women to work, Rosie the Riveter and all that, but in high-level Washington meetings like this, the seats at the table were still reserved for the men.<br><br>The door opened and a man I recognized from the papers as Undersecretary of State Edward Stettinius came in. "Be seated," he said, as the others came to the table. "I've only got a few minutes so I'll be brief. I've called you here to ask for your help in talking to the American people about the war." He launched into a discussion of a new initiative by the Office of War Information to work with the press on the way it would communicate information about the fighting.<br><br>I scribbled furiously. Though I frequently typed the shorthand notes of others, I had seldom taken dictation and I feared I would not be able to keep up with Secretary Stettinius's rapid English. But as I listened, I became absorbed by what he was saying. The relationship between newspapers and government had always seemed adversarial, one seeking information and the other holding it back. But he was speaking now of ways they could work together. "I'm happy to take your questions," he concluded a few minutes later.<br><br>A correspondent from the <em>Washington Star</em> whom I did not recognize raised his hand, then spoke without waiting. "It sounds good on the surface&#x2014;but isn't it something of a conflict of interest?" I had been wondering the same thing: Could the newspapers still maintain their independence and integrity while working with the government?<br><br>Secretary Stettinius offered a vague explanation of how it would all work without compromising the independence of the press.<br><br>"Surely you aren't suggesting we show you our stories before they go to press?" another reporter pressed. "That would be censorship."<br><br>"No, of course not," Secretary Stettinius replied, looking tugging at his collar. "We simply want to be a resource." Across the room, Mr. Steeves folded his arms, unconvinced. "My deputy will be in touch with each of you individually to discuss specifics," Secretary Stettinius promised, cutting the questions short. He rose, signaling that the meeting was over.<br><br>As the newsmen stood and chatted among themselves, I tried to catch Mr. Steeves's eye, but he was engrossed in conversation with a foreign correspondent. I made my way toward the door of the too-stuffy room, uncertain whether to wait for him or return to the bureau.<br><br>As I neared the massive foyer, a door across the hallway opened, letting loose a low din of chatter from another meeting. I started past. "Then we are agreed," a voice broke through the others, unexpectedly familiar. I stopped mid-step. "We'll meet again when we have the plans drawn up."<br><br>Charlie! My head swiveled in the direction from which the voice had come. It couldn't be. I craned my neck, trying once more to hear the voice. I had imagined him so many times since coming here, seen him in every uniformed soldier on the street corners. But I'd never heard his voice.<br><br>I stepped toward the door of the other room, not caring that I had no business being there as I scanned the crowd. "Oh!" I cried so loudly that a man in front of me turned to stare. I brought my hand to my mouth as Charlie's broad shoulders appeared above the others. Joy surged through me, making my head light. It really was him. But how? There was no reason on earth for him to be in Washington. He was meant to be off training somewhere or deployed, not standing in front of me, tall and glorious. Had he come for me? No, there was simply no way he could have known I was here&#x2014;which was exactly how I had wanted it.<br><br>Anxiety rose, eclipsing my happiness, and the walls of the immense room seemed to grow close. I started to duck away, the idea of facing Charlie unfathomable. But even as I took a step toward the door, I turned back, drawn to him. He looked different to be sure, aged by all that had happened, with lines in places I hadn't remembered and a permanent sadness about the eyes. His brown hair was cut short and it was thinner, too, without the thick, rich curls he had once had. He was still beautiful, though. My breath caught. That did not, could not, change what had happened. I had to leave. Now.<br><br>I stepped back toward the corridor, my ankle turning inward and causing me to stumble. As I struggled not to fall, I dropped my notebook, which clattered against the marble. Heads turned in my direction, seeming more annoyed than concerned. As the others resumed their conversations, Charlie stepped from the group and moved toward me in the hall, his face breaking. "Addie?" His tone was disbelieving. I froze, unable to move or speak as he drew close. He reached out, as if to touch me, but his hand foundered midair before falling to his side again. He leaned in to kiss my cheek and his familiar scent made the room wobble. I struggled not to turn and meet his lips with my own. "Addie." There it was in that single word, that voice which cut right through and connected with my insides as it had since the first time I heard it. "What are you doing here?" He didn't know any of it&#x2014;that I had left Philadelphia, or how I had come to be here. Because he had gone first.<br><br>"I'm working for the <em>Post."</em> I watched his face for any sign of disbelief. But Charlie had never doubted me. "I never expected you to be in Washington," I added.<br><br>His face flinched slightly as though he had been slapped. "You aren't pleased to see me."<br><br>"Of course I am. It's just that I thought you were training." My words came out too quickly, piling on top of one another.<br><br>He fumbled with the hat, neatly folded in his hands. "I was, for almost a year. But now I'm here for some extra briefings." There was a strange undercurrent to his voice. A year had slipped through our fingers. How was that possible? Once it had seemed unthinkable to keep breathing without Charlie, but somehow the clock had kept ticking. I tried to imagine his days in between, all of the things he had done and seen since we'd last laid eyes on one another. But my mind was blank.<br><br>"Your hair," he blurted. I raised my hand to my temple, wincing at how tousled I was from the rain. "It's short." It was the bob, so different than last time he had seen me. "I mean, I like it." I couldn't tell if he was just being kind.<br><br>"How's your family?"<br><br>"Holding up as well as can be expected." He shrugged, helpless but not indifferent. "My folks are in Florida. Mom has thrown herself into the women's auxiliary." It sounded so much like Mrs. Connally that I had to smile. "Dad's Dad." Guilt at having left them flickered across his face. "It tore them apart, you know." Yes, I knew only too well. The Connallys lived in a place where their grief would always be as raw as the day it all happened, no matter how much time passed or how far away they moved. "They're together, but in a separate kind of a way. They know now," he added, and I wanted to ask if he meant about the army, or what had been between us, or both.<br><br>The question stuck in my throat. "And the boys?" I asked instead.<br><br>"Jack, well, he works at a plant in Port Richmond. He's taking night classes at Temple, though." Jack had been the real brain of the boys&#x2014;he might have gone to an Ivy League school and practiced medicine as he once dreamed, but for money and circumstance. "He hasn't been called up yet, thank God. Mom couldn't bear to lose another son."<br><br>I swallowed. "And Liam?"<br><br>Charlie stared hard at the floor. "I'm not sure." But surely his parents knew about Liam's whereabouts, and whether or not he was okay. Or had they cut ties with him as well? My stomach tugged. I still hated Liam for what he had done, yet I could not help but worry.<br><br></p><h2>The Last Apprentice (Revenge of the Witch)</h2><p><p>For years, Old Gregory has been the Spook for the county, ridding the local villages of evil. Now his time is coming to an end. But who will take over for him? Twenty-nine apprentices have tried&#x2014;some floundered, some fled, some failed to stay alive.</p><p>Only Thomas Ward is left. He's the last hope, the last apprentice.</p></p><p>"I was going to learn how to protect farms and villages from things that go bump in the night. Dealing with ghouls, boggarts, and all manner of wicked beasties would be all in a day's work. That's what the Spook did, and I was going to be his apprentice." Twelve-year-old Thomas Ward, as the seventh son of a seventh son, has no inheritance and is bored with farm work, and even though his new job will mean the superstitious villagers will forever shun him, he is eager to go off to adventure with the tall, hooded man he calls the Spook. His mother, a magical person herself, approves, and the Spook's teaching is strict but kind. But when Tom has only learned enough to be able to control their house-boggart, he is tricked by Alice, the young daughter of a witch family, into inadvertently releasing and then killing Mother Malkin, a witch the Spook has imprisoned in a pit. This is no polite wicca-type witch, but a snuffling, slime-trailing, cannibalistic creature reminiscent of Tolkien's nasgils. The story of Tom's escape from the reincarnated witch's hideous revenge is full of horrible details, as Alice helps, and then once again betrays him. This well-crafted novel marks an auspicious start for an exciting and fast series for young teens.

Page by page, chapter by chapter, <i>A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake</i> outlines the basic action of Joyce&#x2019;s book, simplifies and clarifies the complex web of images and allusions, and provides an understandable, continuous narrative from which the reader can venture out on his or her own. This edition includes a foreword and updates by Joyce scholar Dr. Edmund L.

Early Christianity was subversive and dangerous&#x2014;dangerous for Christians and a threat to the keepers of the old order. Most of all Christianity was countercultural. But what about contemporary American Christianity? Is it the countercultural way of Jesus or merely a religious endorsement of Americanism? In his provocative book, Postcards From Babylon, Brian Zahnd challenges the reader to see and embrace a daring Jesus-centered Christianity that can again turn the world upside down."In a bold and daring articulation, Brian Zahnd has sketched a 'Theology of the Cross' for our time and place in the United States of the twenty-first century. He does so in a way that deeply resonates with the primal claims of evangelical theology. He sees that the Gospel is inherently and inescapably countercultural because the God of the Gospel is in particular and passionate solidarity with the 'left behind.'"--Walter Brueggemann, Columbia Theological Seminary"If I had miraculous powers, I would interrupt the programming of every religious broadcast in America, then, as Jesus replaced water with wine, I would substitute the message from Brian Zahnd that you&#x2019;ll read in this book. Read it and you&#x2019;ll see why. I recommend that you buy two copies of this book. Immediately read one&#x2014;underline it and extract quotes from it to share on Facebook and Twitter, and refer to it in sermons and casual conversations. Send the other to that friend or relative who likes to talk about God and country. Include a note asking if they&#x2019;d be willing to talk with you about it after they read it. Then see what happens as these Postcards from Babylon do their work in you and in others."--Brian D. McLaren, author of The Great Spiritual Migration"This love letter from a concerned pastor will enrage contemporary Pharaohs and their false prophets who blaspheme by blessing everything that Christ came to free us from. Postcards from Babylon diagnoses the diabolical and invites us to become pilgrims on Christ&#x2019;s narrow road that delivers us out into life."--Jarrod McKenna, pastor, founder of First Home Project for refugees in Australia</p><p></p><h2>The Slave Dancer</h2><p>One day, thirteen-year-old jessie Bollier is earning pennies playing his fife on the docks of New Orleans; the next, he is kidnapped and thrown aboard a slave ship, where his job is to provide music while shackled slaves &#34;dance&#34; to keep their muscles strong and their bodies profitable.

Not only has he created a masterful treatise in which children&#x2019;s root natures are brought to light as key ingredients in their bespoke recoveries, but he has also contributed a beautifully crafted ode to rebuilding attention. Dr. Cowan&#x2019;s support and recommendations have indeed proven transformative for me and for my son, Water child extraordinaire.

Now many analysts believe that other countries are rising and the United States is in decline. Is the unipolar moment over? Is America finished as a superpower?</p><p>In this book, Michael Beckley argues that the United States has unique advantages over other nations that, if used wisely, will allow it to remain the world's sole superpower throughout this century. We are not living in a transitional, post-Cold War era. Instead, we are in the midst of what he calls the unipolar era&#x2015;a period as singular and important as any epoch in modern history. This era, Beckley contends, will endure because the US has a much larger economic and military lead over its closest rival, China, than most people think and the best prospects of any nation to amass wealth and power in the decades ahead.</p><p>Deeply researched and brilliantly argued, this book covers hundreds of years of great power politics and develops new methods for measuring power and predicting the rise and fall of nations. By documenting long-term trends in the global balance of power and explaining their implications for world politics, the book provides guidance for policymakers, businesspeople, and scholars alike.</p></p><p><p>Michael Beckley is a Fellow in the International Security Program at Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and Assistant Professor of Political Science at Tufts University.</p><p>"Is the United States in decline? In this fascinating and well written book, Michael Beckley argues that the United States is and will remain the world&#x2019;s sole superpower. Beckley&#x2019;s novel theory emphasizes the national production, welfare, and security costs that influence relative national power. Drawing on a broad array of sources, he shows that his theory explains changes in the economic and military balance of power over the last 200 years, and that the narrative of American decline and China&#x2019;s rise is therefore flawed. This important book challenges conventional wisdom and should be read by scholars and policymakers alike."</p> (Michael C. Horowitz, University of Pennsylvania)<br><br><p>"Michael Beckley offers a devastating and definitive critique of the idea that we are witnessing the end of the American era. In support of his case, Beckley's book is conceptually clear, empirically unassailable, and analytically fair and objective. It will quickly become a classic in International Security studies."</p> (Keir Lieber, Georgetown University)<br><br><p>"For those who think China is going to overtake the U.S., Michael Beckley says think again. <i>Unrivaled</i> shows that China can't match America's ability to generate wealth and military power. This masterful book backs up Bismarck's quip that "God has a special providence forthe United States."</p> (John Mearsheimer, University of Chicago)<br><br><p>"Michael Beckley has written a terrific, insightful, and persuasive book. By examining a nation&#x2019;s net and not gross power, <i>Unrivaled</i> suggests that China&#x2019;s rise poses much less of a challenge to the position of the United States than is commonly believed. It should be required reading for scholars and policymakers alike."</p> (Taylor Fravel, Massachusetts Institute of Technology)<br><br><p>"Michael&nbsp;Beckley's research demolishes the current China hype, which fills a small library by now. 'America's edge will endure' is the message of this piece, and it is argued with academic rigor, felicity of style, and compelling numbers. <i>Unrivaled</i> will overturn many clich�s about America's 'decline' while greatly improving the intelligence of the debate."</p> (Josef Joffe, Stanford University)<br><br><p>"Beckley&#x2019;s <i>Unrivaled</i> is simply the best book written on the sources of U.S. primacy in today&#x2019;s world. Through a careful analysis of economic and military power, Beckley refutes views of U.S. decline and shows conclusively that the United States is poised to remain the world&#x2019;s unparalleled behemoth for the foreseeable future."</p> (Nuno Monteiro, Yale University, and author of <i>Theory of Unipolar Politics</i>)<br><br><p>"Beckley upends conventional wisdom on the United States&#x2019; global power position. Don&#x2019;t let the lively prose and accessible style trick you into thinking of this as an evanescent intervention in the debate on American decline. <i>Unrivaled</i> is a scholarly tour de force that will reshape the debate and cast a long shadow on subsequent scholarship."</p> (William C.

The book combines traditional approaches proven successful in the teaching of diction with important new material not readily available elsewhere, presenting the sounds of each language in logical order, along with essential information on matters such as diacritical marks, syllabification, word stress, and effective use of the variety of foreign-language dictionaries. Presented in an attractively concise format, the book goes into greater detail than comparable texts, providing specific information to clarify concepts typically difficult for English-speaking singers. Particular emphasis is placed on the characteristics of vowel length, the sequencing of sounds between words, as well as the differences between spoken and sung sounds in all three languages.

When he was nineteen, he became a Dominican for the convent of Santa Cruz, and subsequently served quite successfully as a preacher for forty years. He was a holy, learned, and wise man who published various works on Scripture, ethics, dogma, and Church history throughout his lifetime. His famous <i>Sinner's Guide</i> was originally published in 1555, and is now regarded as a spiritual classic. Also the author of <i>The Book of Prayer and Meditation</i>, he lived to be eighty-four years old.

Or be charming and relaxed on a first date? What <i>is</i> it about a politician who seems wooden or a comedian whose jokes fall flat or an athlete who chokes? In all of these cases, striving seems to backfire. <br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Trying Not To Try, </i>Edward Slingerland explains why we find spontaneity so elusive, and shows how early Chinese thought points the way to happier, more authentic lives. We&#x2019;ve long been told that the way to achieve our goals is through careful reasoning and conscious effort. But recent research suggests that many aspects of a satisfying life, like happiness and spontaneity, are best pursued indirectly. The early Chinese philosophers knew this, and they wrote extensively about an effortless way of being in the world, which they called <i>wu-wei</i> (ooo-way). They believed it was the source of all success in life, and they developed various strategies for getting it and hanging on to it. <br> &nbsp;<br> With clarity and wit, Slingerland introduces us to these thinkers and the marvelous characters in their texts, from the butcher whose blade glides effortlessly through an ox to the wood carver who sees his sculpture simply emerge from a solid block. Slingerland uncovers a direct line from <i>wu-wei</i> to the Force in Star Wars, explains why <i>wu-wei</i> is more powerful than flow, and tells us what it all means for getting a date. He also shows how new research reveals what&#x2019;s happening in the brain when we&#x2019;re in a state of <i>wu-wei</i>&#x2014;why it makes us happy and effective and trustworthy, and how it might have even made civilization possible. <br> &nbsp;<br> Through stories of mythical creatures and drunken cart riders, jazz musicians and Japanese motorcycle gangs, Slingerland effortlessly blends Eastern thought and cutting-edge science to show us how we can live more fulfilling lives. <i>Trying Not To Try</i> is mind-expanding and deeply pleasurable, the perfect antidote to our striving modern culture.</p><p><b>Edward Slingerland</b>&nbsp;is Professor of Asian Studies and Canada Research Chair in Chinese Thought and Embodied Cognition at the University of British Columbia.

The butcher has been called upon to play his part in a traditional religious ceremony involving the sacrifice of an ox, in a public space with the ruler and a large crowd looking on. This is a major religious event, and Butcher Ding is at center stage. The text is not specific, but we are probably witnessing a ceremony to consecrate a newly cast bronze bell. In this ritual, the still-smoking metal is brought fresh from the foundry and cooled with the blood of a sacrificial animal--a procedure that demands precise timing and perfectly smooth execution.<br><br>Butcher Ding is up to the task, dismembering the massive animal with effortless grace: &#x201c;At every touch of his hand, every bending of his shoulder, every step of his feet, every thrust of his knee--swish! swoosh! He guided his blade along with a whoosh, and all was in perfect tune: one moment as if he were joining in the Dance of the Mulberry Grove, another as if he were performing in the Jingshou Symphony.&#x201d; The Dance of the Mulberry Grove and the Jingshou Symphony were ancient, venerated art forms: Ding&#x2019;s body and blade move in such perfect harmony that a seemingly mundane task is turned into an artistic performance. Lord Wenhui is amazed and is moved to exclaim, &#x201c;Ah! How wonderful! Can skill really reach such heights?&#x201d; Butcher Ding puts down his cleaver and replies, &#x201c;What I, your humble servant, care about is the Way [Dao, &#x9053;], which goes beyond mere skill.&#x201d; He then launches into an explanation of what it feels like to perform in such a state of perfect ease:<br><br>When I first began cutting up oxen, all I could see was the ox itself. After three years, I no longer saw the ox as a whole. And now--now I meet it with my spirit and don&#x2019;t look with my eyes. My senses and conscious awareness have shut down and my spiritual desires take me away. I follow the Heavenly pattern of the ox, thrusting into the big hollows, guiding the knife through the big openings, and adapting my motions to the fixed structure of the ox. In this way, I never touch the smallest ligament or tendon, much less a main joint.<br><br>The result is that Butcher Ding is not so much cutting up the ox as releasing its constituent parts, letting the razor-sharp edge of his cleaver move through the spaces between the bones and ligaments without encountering the slightest resistance:<br><br>A skilled butcher has to change his cleaver once a year, because he cuts; an ordinary butcher has to change his cleaver once a month, because he hacks. As for me, I have been using this particular cleaver for nineteen years now, and have cut up thousands of oxen with it, and yet its edge is still as sharp as when it first came off the whetstone. Between the joints of the ox there is space, and the edge of the blade has no thickness; if you use that which has no thickness to pass through gaps where there is space, it&#x2019;s no problem, there&#x2019;s plenty of room to let your cleaver play. That&#x2019;s why, after nineteen years, the edge of my blade looks like it just came from the whetstone.<br><br>It is not all smooth sailing. Occasionally Butcher Ding&#x2019;s effortless dance is interrupted when he senses trouble, at which point his conscious mind seems to reengage a bit, although he still remains completely relaxed and open to the situation confronting him: &#x201c;Whenever I come to a knot, I see the difficulty ahead, become careful and alert, focus my vision, slow my movements, and move the blade with the greatest subtlety, so that the ox simply falls apart, like a clod of earth falling to the ground.&#x201d; Lord Wenhui clearly sees something in this account that goes far beyond simply cutting up oxen. &#x201c;Wonderful!&#x201d; he exclaims. &#x201c;From the words of Butcher Ding I&#x2019;ve learned how to live my life!&#x201d; This remark signals to us that we should be taking the story of the ox as a metaphor: we are Butcher Ding&#x2019;s blade, and the bones and ligaments of the ox are the barriers and obstacles that we face in life. Just as Butcher Ding&#x2019;s blade remains razor-sharp because it never touches a bone or ligament--moving only through the gaps in between--so does the wu-wei person move only through the open spaces in life, avoiding the difficulties that damage one&#x2019;s spirit and wear out one&#x2019;s body. This is a metaphor that has not lost any of its power. I, for one, can attest that, after forty-odd years of sometimes hard living, my own blade feels a bit nicked and dull.<br><br>Another of my favorite portrayals of wu-wei also concerns an artisan. A woodcarver named Qing has received commissions to carve massive wooden stands for sets of bronze bells--precisely the sort of bells that were consecrated in Butcher Ding&#x2019;s ritual sacrifice. Again, this is high-stakes public art, commissioned by the ruler himself, and involving the promise of a juicy monetary reward and official honors. As with Ding, Qing demonstrates almost supernatural skill: the bell stands that he produces are so exquisite that people think they must be the work of ghosts or spirits. Like Butcher Ding, he is praised by his ruler, who exclaims, &#x201c;What technique allows you to produce something that beautiful?&#x201d; Again, like Ding, the woodcarver demurs, denying that what he does is all that special. &#x201c;I, your servant, am merely a humble artisan. What technique could I possibly possess?&#x201d; After being pressed a bit, though, he acknowledges that perhaps there is a secret to his success, having to do with how he prepares himself mentally to begin the work: &#x201c;When I am getting ready to make a bell stand, the most important thing is not to exhaust my energy [qi], so first I fast in order to still my mind. After I have fasted for three days, concerns about congratulations or praise, titles or stipends no longer trouble my mind. After five days, thoughts of blame or acclaim, skill or clumsiness have also left my mind. Finally, after fasting for seven days, I am so completely still that I forget that I have four limbs and a body.&#x201d; The idea of carving a bell stand without a sense of one&#x2019;s limbs or body might seem odd, but the point is that Qing has so focused his attention that all external considerations have fallen away. &#x201c;There is no more ruler or court,&#x201d; he explains, &#x201c;my skill is concentrated and all outside distractions disappear.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s ready to get to work.<br><br>Now I set off for the mountain forest to observe, one by one, the Heavenly nature of the trees. If I come across a tree of perfect shape and form, then I am able to see the completed bell stand already in it: all I have to do is apply my hand to the job and it&#x2019;s done. If a particular tree does not call to me, I simply move on. All that I am doing is allowing the Heavenly within me to match up with the Heavenly in the world--this is probably why people mistake my art for the work of the spirits!<br><br>It&#x2019;s striking how similar this story is to the lore surrounding a great public artist from an entirely different time and culture, Michelangelo. When questioned about his own apparently supernatural sculpting talents, he supposedly replied that, when given a commission, he simply waited until he found a piece of marble in which he could already see the sculpture. All he then had to do was cut away the stone that didn&#x2019;t belong. Here, as with Woodcarver Qing, there is a sense that the materials themselves dictate the artistic process. The artist&#x2019;s own contribution is portrayed as minimal, and the creative act is experienced as completely effortless.<br><br>The stories of Butcher Ding and Woodcarver Qing both come from a book called the Zhuangzi, one of the two Daoist works that we will be looking at, and the richest hunting ground for wu-wei stories among Warring States texts. Characterizations of wu-wei in the other of our early Daoist texts, the Laozi, take the form of concise, cryptic poems rather than stories--much of the book probably rhymed in the original Chinese pronunciation, which we can now only imprecisely reconstruct. A typically mysterious passage from the Laozi describing the &#x201c;Way of Heaven&#x201d; is clearly meant to provide a model for how a properly cultivated person should move through the world:<br><br>The Way of Heaven<br><br>Excels in overcoming, though it does not contend;<br><br>In responding, though it does not speak;<br><br>In spontaneously attracting, though it does not summon;<br><br>In planning for the future, though it is always relaxed.<br><br>The Net of Heaven covers all;<br><br>Although its mesh is wide, nothing ever slips through.<br><br>The &#x201c;wide mesh&#x201d; that nonetheless captures everything is reminiscent of the relaxed concentration of Butcher Ding or Woodcarver Qing: at ease and yet open, profoundly attuned to the environment. Unlike our Zhuangzian exemplars, however, who attain perfection only after long periods of training in particular skills, the Laozian sage attains wu-wei by not trying, by simply relaxing into some sort of preexisting harmony with nature:<br><br>Do not go out the door, and so understand the whole world;<br><br>Do not look out the window, and understand the Way of Heaven.<br><br>The farther you go, the less you know.<br><br>This is why the sage understands the world without going abroad,<br><br>Achieves clarity without having to look,<br><br>And attains success without trying.<br><br>These sorts of passages, where wu-wei is an explicit focus, are quite common throughout the Zhuangzi and the Laozi, which is why the concept of wu-wei is typically associated with Daoism.<br><br>What is less widely appreciated, however, is that the sort of effortless ease and unselfconsciousness that characterizes these Daoist accounts also plays a central role in early Confucianism. This may come as a surprise, because Confucianism is typically associated with hidebound traditionalism and stuffy ritual--both of which strike us as the opposite of wu-wei. It can&#x2019;t be denied that the Confucians do a lot to earn this reputation. In the early stages of training, an aspiring Confucian gentleman needs to memorize entire shelves of archaic texts, learn the precise angle at which to bow, and learn the length of the steps with which he is to enter a room. His sitting mat must always be perfectly straight. All of this rigor and restraint, however, is ultimately aimed at producing a cultivated, but nonetheless genuine, form of spontaneity. Indeed, the process of training is not considered complete until the individual has passed completely beyond the need for thought or effort.<br><br>Confucius himself, in a passage that serves as a wonderfully concise spiritual autobiography, portrays wu-wei as the goal for which he has spent his entire life striving: &#x201c;The Master said, &#x2018;At fifteen I set my mind upon learning; at thirty I took my place in society; at forty I became free of doubts; at fifty I understood Heaven&#x2019;s Mandate; at sixty my ear was attuned; and at seventy I could follow my heart&#x2019;s desires without transgressing the bounds of propriety.&#x2019; &#x201d; The phrase &#x201c;my ear was attuned&#x201d; literally means &#x201c;my ear flowed along / went with the flow&#x201d; and suggests that when hearing the teachings of the ancients Confucius immediately grasped and took joy in them. By age seventy, he had so internalized the Confucian Way that he could act upon whatever thought or desire popped into his head and yet still behave in a perfectly moral and exemplary fashion. The end result looks as effortless and unselfconscious as that of the Zhuangzian butcher or Laozian sage but is, in fact, the product of a lifelong process of training in traditional cultural forms.<br><br>Confucius&#x2019;s form of wu-wei--an effortless, unselfconscious but eminently cultured spontaneity--was inherited as an ideal by his two Warring States followers, Mencius and Xunzi, although they disagreed profoundly about what&#x2019;s required to reach this state. Mencius tried to split the difference, as it were, between the Daoists and Confucius by presenting wu-wei as the natural outgrowth of cultivating our nature. For him, morally proper wu-wei was like a sprout waiting to break through the ground, or a body prepared to move with a catchy beat. Xunzi, on the other hand, was unimpressed by the Daoist celebration of nature and returned to the model championed by Confucius, whereby wu-wei was the result of a lifetime of rigorous education. For Xunzi, &#x201c;not trying&#x201d; was neither easy nor fun: the perfection of form and emotion that finds its ideal expression in dance was, for him, a hard-won achievement resulting from years of difficult training and cultural learning. In any case, this preoccupation with how to cultivate wu-wei was at the center of early Chinese controversies about how to attain the good life. This is a conversation worth paying attention to, because it brings to the forefront ideas, like spontaneity and charisma, that have fallen through the cracks of our contemporary mind-set.<br><br>YOUR BRAIN ON WU-WEI<br><br>In the early Chinese accounts of wu-wei described above, a couple of features are immediately apparent. First, although there is only one Butcher Ding or Confucius in the world, these wu-wei exemplars experience themselves as split. They seem to feel a gap between an &#x201c;I&#x201d; (the locus of consciousness and personal identity) and various forces--spiritual desires, desires of the heart--that take over when they enter wu-wei. Wu-wei is characterized by an internal sense of effortlessness and unselfconsciousness, even though the person in wu-wei may actually be very active in the world. Someone or something else must be doing the work besides the conscious mind that we normally think of as &#x201c;us.&#x201d; Second, people in wu-wei are extremely effective: huge oxen fall apart with a few swipes of the blade, and complex social situations are negotiated with masterly aplomb. My guess is that we have all experienced this combination of effortlessness and effectiveness at some point in our lives. While we are completely absorbed in chopping and saut�ing, a complex dinner simply assembles itself before our eyes. Fully relaxed, we breeze through an important job interview without even noticing how well it&#x2019;s going. Our own experiences of the pleasure and power of spontaneity explain why these early Chinese stories are so appealing and also suggest that these thinkers were on to something important. Combining Chinese insights and modern science, we are now in a position to understand how such states can actually come about.<br><br>Colloquially, we often speak of ourselves as if we were split in two: &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t make myself get out of bed this morning,&#x201d; &#x201c;I had to force myself to be calm,&#x201d; &#x201c;I had to hold my tongue.&#x201d; Although we use such phrases all the time, if you think about them they&#x2019;re a bit weird. Who is the self who doesn&#x2019;t want to get out of bed, and what is its relationship to me? Does my tongue really have a will of its own, and how do I go about holding it? (And who am I if not my tongue?) Since there is always only one &#x201c;me&#x201d; involved, this split-self talk is clearly metaphorical rather than literal. At the same time, the fact that we fall back upon this kind of language so frequently means that it must reflect something important about our experience. And talk of split selves is certainly not limited to English: we can see it in many wu-wei stories from early China that involve a narrative &#x201c;I&#x201d; confronting a part of the self that is more or less autonomous.</p><h2>The Foundations of Statistics</h2><p>With the 1954 publication of his <i>Foundations of Statistics, </i>in which he proposed a basis that takes into account not only strictly objective and repetitive events, but also vagueness and interpersonal differences, Leonard J. Savage opened the greatest controversy in modern statistical thought. His theory of the foundations, connected with the personalistic interpretation of probability, challenged the then dominant frequentist school. <br>In the first seven chapters of his book, Professor Savage is concerned with the foundations at a relatively deep level. To explain and defend his theory of the behavior of a highly idealized person faced with uncertainty, he considers decision making, the sure-thing principle, qualitative and quantitative personal probability, the approach to certainty through experience, symmetric sequences of events, critical comments on personal probability, utility, observations as they affect the decision, and partition problems. In chapters eight through seventeen he discusses statistics proper &#x2014; the actual devices of the discipline &#x2014; from the personalistic view. He concentrates on minimax problems and on the theories of estimation and testing. Exercises are included throughout to reinforce and supplement the text. The mathematical techniques used are quite elementary, some calculus and elementary probability theory being presupposed. Understanding of all the material calls for some mathematical maturity on the part of the reader. Professor Savage had reevaluated his position somewhat during the decade and a half since the work was first published. While reaffirming the material in the first seven chapters, he had reconsidered the appropriateness of many frequentistic applications. To explain these recent developments, he added a new preface, new footnotes, and a supplementary 180-item, annotated bibliography. Because of Professor Savage's death, the revisions that he made for this edition are his final analysis of the situation.<br>As he says on page one, "the foundations are the most controversial parts of many, if not all, sciences." In statistics, the foundation of probability is "as controversial a subject as one could name." In 1954, the controversy was very great, and although it has quieted since, the problem has yet to be resolved. A new generation of readers who have missed Savage's analysis have here an opportunity to study firsthand what his important foundation of statistics &#x2014; personal probability &#x2014; is, and what it means to statistical thought.<br></p><p></p><h2>Interviewing Children and Adolescents: Skills and Strategies for Effective DSM-5� Diagnosis</h2><p>This instructive clinical resource has given thousands of clinicians and students essential skills for evaluating infants through adolescents with any type of mental health issue.

Dr. Kennedy lives in Brooklyn, NY with her husband and two children.</p>Introduction <p></p> <p>Of all the anxieties that plague expecting parents as the due date approaches, fear of sleep deprivation is among the most intense. Everyone knows that the first several weeks are the most difficult. But it is actually what happens after those weeks that determines how well you and your family will function during the first year and beyond.</p> <p>My clients often ask about my own children. And, yes, they are great sleepers. I was dedicated to shaping their sleep habits from the start, partly because I needed them to sleep. I am not one of those people who can function without a decent night&#x2019;s rest.</p> <p>When I was pregnant with my son, fear of months (or years) of exhaustion inspired me to put together quite a sleep library. At the hospital where I was working, I&#x2019;d already spent the prior year and a half immersing myself in research to develop a treatment program for adult and geriatric insomnia. While child and adult sleep differ in many ways, certain common principles apply (see Chapter 1). In reading about infant sleep, I was most intrigued by Marc Weissbluth&#x2019;s model of keeping babies well rested and preventing them from becoming overtired. This became the single most important parenting strategy that my husband and I employed.</p> <p>We tried to ignore the raised eyebrows of friends and relatives who could not believe how much our son was sleeping. I noticed that what often seemed like common sense to me was counterintuitive to others. But soon it became apparent to them that my &#x201c;trick&#x201d; was working, and I started helping friends get their kids&#x2019; sleep on track. Pregnant with my daughter, I began thinking about opening a specialty practice to help other new and expecting parents get off on the right foot. I developed a class called Raise a Good Sleeper and later launched my clinical practice, NYC Sleep Doctor, to work with families stuck in a cycle of bad sleep. Since then, I&#x2019;ve helped hundreds of families make simple changes to improve their sleep, and I&#x2019;ve supported them through the process of making the difficult ones.</p> <p>It is my firm belief that good sleepers are not born but raised. In this book you will find the basic information you need to raise a good sleeper. There are plenty of sleep manuals on the market to guide you through the specifics of various sleep-training strategies. The trouble is, there is no one-size-fits-all technique. Every family is a complex mix of individual temperaments and philosophies. The sheer number of options is overwhelming, deterring many parents from even trying to read up on the subject. And parents who do delve into the literature too often give up because they cannot agree on a strategy or because they don&#x2019;t fully understand the reasoning behind it.</p> <p>This book is my effort to help people sift through the vast and often confusing information out there and identify strategies that make sense. My goal is to give you a fundamental grasp of infant sleep: how it works, how much is needed, and how to shape good habits. Understanding these principles will help you figure out which strategies will work for you and your family.</p> <p>In my work, I insist on having parents work together to create a plan. It takes a team effort to stay focused and consistent. I recommend that you read this book together and discuss your priorities and fears before the baby is born. Once he or she arrives, you won&#x2019;t have time to read, digest, discuss, plan, or do much more than cope. Of course, your best-laid plans will have to be adjusted and calibrated once your baby arrives. But it is well worth doing the advance planning. The quality of your baby&#x2019;s sleep will have a tremendous impact on your quality of life.</p> <p>If you did not plan ahead, you certainly aren&#x2019;t alone. Reading sleep manuals is never high on most expecting parents&#x2019; list of priorities. If you and your child are stuck in a cycle of bad sleep, you are probably doing whatever is necessary just to get through each day and night. But your coping strategies might not be improving the situation&#x2014;and they could be reinforcing the problem. Once you&#x2019;re mired in it, it&#x2019;s very hard to decide which strategy will lead you out.</p> <p>Having a good sleeper is not about luck or genes; it is a part of raising a family, and it requires skill, knowledge, and dedication. It is about developing the confidence to identify problems and get back on track quickly.</p> <p>My children are great sleepers, but they have hit the same bumps in the road that all children do. We have dealt with colic, crying, bedtime battles, early waking, illness, repeated pacifier replacement, room-sharing issues, overstimulation, and more. Sometimes we have struggled to know how to respond, but when we make a wrong turn, we go back to the basics and change course. This book will give you those basics, too.</p>The Good Sleeper Approach to Infant Sleep <p></p> <p>Since opening my private practice, NYC Sleep Doctor, I have entered new parents&#x2019; homes and lives when they are at their most confused and vulnerable. I have listened to hundreds of exasperated couples as they describe their love for a baby whose sleeplessness is threatening their confidence as parents, their sanity, and even their marriage. They describe how lost they feel as they listen to friendly advice and pore over countless books about sleep. But by the end of our 90-minute visit, they have a firm understanding of what they have missed all along: the simple facts of infant sleep and how to use that knowledge to teach their baby to sleep.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s not particularly complicated, yet no one seems to have figured out how to explain these concepts and strategies to parents. Pediatricians assess virtually every developmental milestone except sleep. Books, as I will show, are confusing and make promises they can&#x2019;t deliver on. Friends, family, and &#x201c;parenting coaches&#x201d; give advice based on their personal experience, which does little to reassure frightened parents who fear doing psychological or physical damage to their child.</p> <p>In my practice, I have immersed myself in the world of infant sleep&#x2014;the science and the psychology of it. When I first started charging fees for my services, I had the usual crisis of confidence: Was I really doing something for these families that they couldn&#x2019;t do themselves? Wasn&#x2019;t this information so straightforward that anyone could figure it out? What I found, as enthusiastic reports came back from parents and as their friends started hiring me, was that what seemed common sense to me was not evident to most parents. I also discovered that I could transform the necessary information into common-sense guidelines for my clients.</p> <p>I spent eight years at the Manhattan Veterans Affairs Medical Center helping patients suffering from arguably the most challenging of sleep issues. Through my experience working with veterans suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder and other serious mental illnesses, I learned how to relate scientific and clinical knowledge to lots of very tough real-life situations. I taught psychology interns how to be concise, responsible writers. I am known among my colleagues and friends as a straight talker&#x2014;a trait that has gotten me into trouble from time to time but has also been one of my defining professional qualities. My colleagues refer patients to me who need a no-nonsense therapist, one who won&#x2019;t mince words. My presentations are well edited and concise, focusing on the essential points I need to communicate.</p> <p>I don&#x2019;t use jargon, and I don&#x2019;t try to impress people with fancy explanations of simple concepts. My goal is to be an effective communicator, and I do that by getting to the point. When I treat my patients, when I teach classes about sleep, or when I lecture students or executives, I typically check in and ask: &#x201c;Does that make sense?&#x201d; I do this because I care about my audience, whether it be an individual client, a couple, or a room full of students.</p> <p>Parents often contact me hoping to put the problem in my hands, expecting me to do something magical to make it disappear. From the beginning, I emphasize that the solution is not magical. My job is to help parents unravel the problem, to determine how and when to intervene, and to arm parents with the knowledge and confidence they need to work through the problem themselves. Parents often ask if I do overnight stays. I don&#x2019;t&#x2014;and not just because I have my own family. I don&#x2019;t do overnights because parents have to learn how to manage their child&#x2019;s sleep on their own.</p> <p>I have worked with countless babies with uneventful histories or minor issues like colic. But I have also worked with babies who have had a much harder time: deaf babies, babies who have had neonatal heart surgery or long NICU stays, and babies and toddlers who have developmental disabilities and serious medical issues. Obviously, special circumstances can affect the methods. But even in these cases, the basic principles apply.</p> <p>The first things I look for when I&#x2019;m working with clients are:</p> <p>1. The bedtime: The bedtime is almost always too late. Parents fear that putting their babies to bed too early will cause them to wake up early in the morning. The exact opposite is true. An early bedtime is the key to a good night (and reasonable wake-up time).</p> <p>2. Naps (where, when, and how long): Parents often fear that allowing a baby to sleep during the day will compromise night sleep. Most parents do not understand the importance of naps and nap quality.</p> <p>3. Short-term survival strategies that are undermining long-term progress: These can include responding immediately when the baby fusses, co-sleeping, excessive baby wearing, or always waiting to put the baby down fully asleep. Once parents understand their child&#x2019;s process of learning to sleep, they become willing to loosen their grip on survival strategies that are only serving to reinforce the problem.</p> <p>Another very common problem is the parents&#x2019; fear of their babies&#x2019; crying or distress. Parents in the United States struggle to foster healthy sleep in their children because they are afraid to allow them to experience distress. They are unable to differentiate between what the child wants and what she needs. Either that, or they simply can&#x2019;t bear to side with the needs over the wants. It&#x2019;s a short-term solution (ending distress or crying by &#x201c;helping&#x201d; a baby sleep) that creates a long-term problem (a child that cannot rely on himself to fall asleep independently).</p> <p>Over the years, I have seen this problem play out in countless ways. There are the men who want to be different from their overbearing fathers and will do anything to avoid &#x201c;causing&#x201d; their child distress. There are the parents who coslept with their own parents and recall the difficult transition out of the family bed (when they were old enough to remember); they want to avoid cosleeping but feel judged by their families or peers. There are parents who are essentially traumatized by colic or extreme fussiness in their baby or in an older child and feel unable to tolerate any more crying. There are parents who believe that depriving a child of their attention will create long-term personality defects or even sociopathy (much more on this later). There are parents who fear that they simply don&#x2019;t possess the skills to raise their children effectively, and parents who simply can&#x2019;t agree on a strategy.</p> <p>Parenting styles naturally shift over the generations in response to changing mores, as well as medical, educational, scientific, and technological advances. But parenting styles also shift as people embrace or reject the merits of their own childhoods. From the late 1960s through the 1980s, the pendulum seems to have swung toward less involved parenting. Society was more focused on self-exploration and fulfillment. As parents made their personal goals and happiness the priorities, the focus on children became less central.</p> <p>As those children have become the next generation of parents, they have swung the pendulum back, overcorrecting for what they perceive to have been their own parents&#x2019; disengagement. Many parents today feel compelled to be involved in every aspect of their child&#x2019;s experience, to be omnipresent, to soothe away every discomfort. These are impossible tasks, and they create a lot of problems. Children who cannot tolerate normal discomforts like boredom, sharing, or having a toy jerked away from them by another baby don&#x2019;t develop the essential life skill that psychologists call distress tolerance. These children believe they are entitled to be entertained and joyful at all times. Of course, it&#x2019;s important for children to be happy and entertained. But parents&#x2019; efforts to prevent or soothe away all discomfort teach children that there is something dangerous about being unhappy.</p>As parents, we all must accept that a child&#x2019;s needs come before his or her wants. <p></p> <p>I see it as my job to teach parents that one of the primary challenges they will face is accepting that a child&#x2019;s needs must come before his wants. Clarifying this battle of needs and wants helps parents to understand the challenge at hand. It gives them the courage to begin the task of parenting. It gives them permission to prioritize needs and take care of their child&#x2019;s best interest, even when the child is protesting. I teach parents about <i>authoritative parenting</i>, which provides the structure to keep the child safe by setting appropriate limits while also allowing the child room to explore and experiment, precisely because he knows that his parents will be there for him if he fails. (Not incidentally, it is this type of parenting that has been found to result in secure attachment and healthy adjustment in the long term.)</p> <p>The principles and strategies in this book will help you to find a rhythm that brings some sanity to your new life as a parent. The information here will inform your decisions about how to get your baby the sleep she needs while also remaining flexible enough to enjoy your time with your newborn. Countless couples have told me that they wish that someone had explained these things before they became stuck in a cycle of bad sleep. That is precisely what The Good Sleeper will do.</p> <p><br>Copyright � 2015 by Janet Krone Kennedy, PhD</p></p><h2>VW New Beetle 1998-2010 Repair Manual (Haynes Repair Manual)</h2><p><p>With a Haynes manual, you can do it yourself...from simple maintenance to basic repairs.

TEN SEASONED RANGERS. ONE IMPOSSIBLE RESCUE.</b> <br><br>On the afternoon of July 26, 2003, six vacationing mountain climbers ascended the peak of the Grand Teton in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Rain and colliding air currents blew in, and soon a massive electrical charge began to build. As the group began to retreat from its location, a colossal lightning bolt struck and pounded through the body of every climber. One of the six died instantly, one lay critically injured next to her body, and four dangled perilously into the chasm below. In riveting, page-turning prose, veteran journalist Jennifer Woodlief tells the story of the climb, the arrival of the storm, and the unprecedented rescue by the Jenny Lake Rangers, one of the most experienced climbing search-and-rescue teams in the country. <br><br>Against the dramatic landscape of the Teton Range, Woodlief brings to life the grueling task of the rangers, a band of colorful characters who tackle one of the riskiest, most physically demanding jobs in the world. By turns terrifying and exhilarating, <i>A Bolt from the Blue </i>is both a testament to human courage and an astonishing journey into one of history&#x2019;s most dangerous mountain rescues.</p><p><b>Jennifer Woodlief</b>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;former reporter for <i>Sports Illustrated.</i> Her first book <i>Ski to Die: The Bill Johnson Story</i> (2005) was optioned by Warner Brothers with Matthew McConaughey to play Bill.

The aircraft was a Bell 406 Long Ranger L-IV high altitude, meaning that the innards of a Jet Ranger were boosted with a bit more horsepower and the tail rotor enlarged, approximately a $100,000 conversion. The modification gave the pilot more grip at altitude. Few helicopters are able to operate at 14,000 feet, much less with an increased pay-load capacity&#x2014;this particular ship was a special piece of equipment, and quite the secret weapon in terms of mountain rescue.<br> <br>Helicopter N772LM, nicknamed Two-Lima Mike for its call letters, was flown by Laurence Perry, a dashing 50-year-old Brit renowned as much for his flippant attitude on the approach to an accident site as his proficiency at shutting the joking down cold once he arrived on-scene. As one of the few pilots in the world capable of passing the flying exam required by the Jenny Lake rangers&#x2014;a test that required, in part, a pilot to hold a nearly dead hover for two minutes straight while balancing a 200-pound log on the end of a 100-foot rope&#x2014;Laurence&#x2019;s eccentricities were roundly accepted.<br> <br>In more than 18,000 flight hours, Laurence had never operated a helicopter exactly like this one before arriving in the Tetons, but he had become comfortable flying it on rescue operations with the Jenny Lake climbing rangers in the past couple of years. In reality, Laurence could be trusted, and was willing, to fly most any type of aircraft, although technically he was licensed only as a helicopter pilot.<br> <br>On the afternoon of July 26, 2003, Laurence was transporting two park rangers, both of whom were wholly unmoved by the sweeping, iconic setting of Grand Teton National Park, on a reconnaissance flight. At that moment, the Grand Teton&#x2014;the highest peak in the Teton range in Jackson, Wyoming, and a mountaineering classic within the climbing community&#x2014;was nothing more than the extraordinarily unwieldy scene of a tragic accident.<br> <br>As Laurence climbed closer to the top of the mountain, the rangers&#x2019; thoughts were already whirling around how to reach the victims, what to pack for the rescue, where best to be inserted into the scene. Much of this analysis was weather-dependent. If the pause in the storm held, Laurence would short-haul the rangers straight to the site, an extremely advanced rescue procedure in which rangers hang underneath a helicopter on the end of a rope the length of two basketball courts and disconnect from that line directly onto the mountainside. Short-hauling minimizes a helicopter&#x2019;s hover time in the air but exposes the rescuer to incredible risk, especially in turbulent weather.<br> <br>The rangers had received some information from the scene itself, transmitted to the ranger station by cell phone 45 minutes earlier from one of the victims on the mountain. They knew that several climbers had all been struck by a single bolt of lightning just shy of the 13,770-foot summit of the Grand Teton on the Exum Ridge on a 120-foot section of smooth, steep granite known as Friction Pitch.<br> <br>The rangers were aware that someone in the 13-member climbing party was performing CPR on one of the victims and that there was an array of other burn injuries, including paralysis. They also understood that three of the climbers had hurtled out of sight below Friction Pitch, presumably in a treacherous area of the mountain called the Golden Staircase.<br> <br>As the helicopter climbed, the rangers searched for figures on or below the brilliant glow of the Golden Staircase, but they couldn&#x2019;t make out any signs of life. About 100 feet below Friction Pitch, in the midst of a vertical sheer rock face by the Jern Crack, they did see three people clinging to the side of the mountain, their ropes apparently tangled in a few rock spurs positioned just above an abyss.<br> <br>When they reached the top of Friction Pitch, the rangers were momentarily staggered by the sheer scope of the accident site. There were several seemingly dazed climbers wandering above the pitch, a young man with sandy hair and a vacant expression leaning against a large outcropping of rock, a motionless young woman slumped over the top of the ridge, and, most sickening of all, another figure, whom the rangers would come to call the Folded Man, swinging upside-down from a rope about 50 feet down the mountainside. It was completely unclear to them how far he had fallen or how he had ended up in that location. His body was twisted into a sharp inverted V, the back of his head almost touching the heels of his feet, his belly button skyward. He was utterly still.<br> <br>Leo Larson, something of a Fabio doppelg�nger at six-foot-five and 195 pounds, his long blond hair pulled back in a loose ponytail, calmly snapped a few photos to share with the other rangers back in the rescue cache. Both Leo, age 47, and Dan Burgette, the second ranger in the chopper, had been with the Jenny Lake team before they had even begun using short-haul insertions in the mid-1980s. As the day progressed, Dan&#x2019;s duty as spotter in the ship would be taken over by Renny Jackson, head ranger, 27-year Jenny Lake veteran, and all-around legendary climber.<br> <br>The Folded Man remained limp and unmoving, and both Leo and Dan silently began calculating the safest way to recover the suspended body intact. Watching him rotate in the wind, contorted in the most unnatural of positions with no effort to struggle, the rescuers presumed that he was no longer alive. Still, Laurence kept the helicopter stable, lingering in the air about 60 feet away, as they checked to be sure.<br> <br>Laurence and Leo were on the side of the aircraft closer to the mountain. Laurence, in particular, was transfixed by the man&#x2019;s torso split in that pose&#x2014;as he later said, he didn&#x2019;t realize a body could do that&#x2014;and he felt a wave of sadness wash over him as he flashed on images of forlorn bodies snarled in ropes and swaying in remote and precipitous regions of the Eiger.<br> <br>It was while he was lamenting the desperate loneliness of epic mountain deaths that Laurence believed he glimpsed the man&#x2019;s hand twitch&#x2014;or else merely witnessed his fingers flutter in a gust of wind. Laurence looked back at Leo and Dan and, in as unruffled a tone as perhaps only a pilot holding a hover at high altitude can marshal, said, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s alive.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Leo said. &#x201c;I saw it, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>And as simply as that, the mission, at least as it applied to the victim who was hanging, in every true sense, on to his life by a thread, very distinctly took on the heightened urgency of a lifesaving rescue.<br> <br>Traditionally, in a climbing-related rescue, rangers respond to a single person in trouble. In this situation, the multiple victims alone rendered the operation outrageously complicated, requiring a team of rescuers versed, and secure, in enduring a perpetually fluid and ever-worsening series of circumstances and weather conditions.<br> <br>In the summer of 2003, the Jenny Lake climbing rangers were faced with several critically injured victims spread over a variety of different locations on the mountain, with turbulent weather, diminishing daylight, and extreme vertical terrain just below the mountain summit. The risk was further ratcheted up with the necessity that the pilot execute precision, high-altitude helicopter maneuvers in the midst of a lightning storm while rangers dangled from the end of a 100-foot rope. Beyond relying on trust, experience, and instinct to execute a flawless&#x2014;literally flawless&#x2014;rescue, the rangers would also need every twist of luck to go their way. The chances of the rescuers extricating all of the victims before darkness grounded the helicopter were devastatingly remote and dwindling by the second.<br> <br>This is the story of the Jenny Lake rangers beating those odds.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>It is a rare thing for a ranger to save a life, even in the world of mountain rescue. Given the violent nature of mountaineering injuries and the remoteness of their locations, most serious accidents are fatal. The rangers in Grand Teton National Park confronted several deaths every summer season. This would, however, be the first time a climber had been killed in the park by a lightning strike.<br> <br>Leo glanced up at the progress of the storm, the fading light. He and Dan made the briefest eye contact. It was unspoken, but they both knew it would take something damn close to a miracle for their team to pluck all of the victims off the mountain before nightfall. Success would necessitate the most complex and sensational operation ever performed in the park. It would require, in fact, what is widely considered the most spectacular rescue in the history of American mountaineering.<br> <br>For a frozen moment, Leo looked steadily at Laurence, blue eyes meeting blue eyes, then nodded briskly, definitively, at the pilot. In response, he dipped his rotors and veered down to the Saddle.</p><h2>Modern Hand Stitching: Dozens of Stitches with Creative Free-Form Variations (Landauer) Step-by-Step Instructions and Full Color Illustrations for Both Beginners and Advanced Embroiderers</h2><p><p><b>Enjoy the confidence of knowing basic stitches and let your stitching spirit play to your heart's content!</b></p><ul><li><b>Directions for more than 35 different stitches</b>, all arranged by how they're made</li><li><b>A gallery of stitchwork</b> for inspiration to practice, play, and create</li><li><b>Step-by-step instructions</b> and full color illustrations</li><li><b>Dozens of variations</b> on straight stitches, building stitches, cross stitches, knots, chain stitches, and more</li></ul><p></p><p>Tired of looking for just the right stitch reference, author Ruth Chandler decided to create the handbook herself&#x2014;and here it is!</p><p><i>Modern Hand Stitching</i> features six stitch chapters with dozens of variations on straight stitches, building stitches, cross stitches, chain stitches, knots, couching, wrapping, and making a stitch sampler, plus a gallery of stitching inspirations.</p><p>Stitching is fun, exhilarating and artistic.

It can turn professionals into jelly and dominate the games of most amateurs. It alters swing paths, causes &#x201c;tap-in&#x201d; putts to go awry, and transforms a golfer from a brilliant shot-maker on the practice range into an incompetent hack on the course.<br><br>Most golfers understand this, but do not have the tools to overcome it. That&#x2019;s where Dr. Gio Valiante comes in. A pioneering sports psychologist, Valiante has studied the sources of an athlete&#x2019;s fear, investigated the physiological and neurological impact of fear on performance, and, most important of all, developed a groundbreaking program for conquering it. With Valiante's help and by applying Fearless Golf, Justin Leonard went from three consecutive missed cuts to three consecutive top tens, and Chad Campbell recently moved from 98th in the world to 7th. Davis Love III went from zero wins in 2002 to four wins in 2003, and Chris DiMarco made the 2004 Ryder Cup Team.<br><br>Emphasizing the need to replace a fixation-on-results with a commitment to mastery of one&#x2019;s body and one's mind, Valiante&#x2019;s approach will not only help golfers reach their true potential, it will make playing every round fun again. Through concrete confidence and mastery drills, he presents specific ways readers can break free of fear&#x2019;s grasp and perform at their best&#x2014;even under the most extreme pressure. <br><br>With detailed quotes and anecdotes given exclusively to Dr. Valiante from the best players in the game&#x2014;including Jack Nicklaus, Ernie Els, and other tour professionals, <i>Fearless Golf</i> is the ultimate guide to the mental game, the hottest topic in golf today.</p></p><p><p>Dr. Gio Valiante has worked as a mental game consultant to the PGA Tour's hottest players, including Chad Campbell, Heath Slocum, Justin Leonard, Davis Love III, David Duval, Matt Kuchar, and Chris DiMarco. He is the mental game consultant to <i>Golf Digest</i>, The Golf Channel, and the University of Florida.<br><br>Mike Stachura has been an editor at <i>Golf Digest</i> since 1992. He has written numerous instruction stories and served as Travel Editor and most recently Equipment Editor. He lives in Connecticut with his wife, Kathy, daughter, Annie Kate, and son, Jack.</p>CHAPTER 1<br><br>Fear Is the Enemy<br>Jack Nicklaus once wrote that "fear of any kind is the number one enemy of all golfers, regardless of ball-striking and shot-making capabilities. [Fear] happened to me before my early success enabled me to control my fear."<br><br>Nicklaus knew fear can take hold of even the most skilled golfers, leaving them not only unable to function to the best of their physical abilities but also dumbstruck by the basic mental mechanics of the game. Nicklaus knew the power of fear from personal experience. It was the 1960 U.S. Open that taught the young Nicklaus the power of fear and the power of focus. He finished second in the U.S. Open that year, a championship many observers believed he might have won. Even Nicklaus admitted he had a chance, until fear got in the way. Leading the tournament by a shot late in the final round, Nicklaus found himself distracted by the moment. On the sixteenth hole, he struck a short birdie putt too boldly after thinking how hard it would be for others to catch him with a two-shot lead. But it got worse for the young champion. Staring at a short par putt with his fellow competitor Ben Hogan standing by, Nicklaus noticed a poorly repaired pitch mark in the line of his putt. He wasn't sure he could repair it under the rules, though he in fact could. In his book <i>My Most Memorable Shots in the Majors</i>, Nicklaus wrote:<br><br>Excited, anxious and under as much pressure as I've ever known, I can't focus my mind clearly on whether the rules allow me to repair the ball mark. Also, I'm too shy or embarrassed to admit this in front of Hogan or to hold up play by asking an official. So I go ahead and stroke the putt. The mark deflects the ball just enough to spin it out. I bogey, then three-putt the next green.<br><br>Of course, Arnold Palmer won that championship by two shots over Nicklaus, whose fear of the moment shut down his ability to think clearly and act decisively. Fear is a powerful force. It can be destructive, but it can also teach us. As Nicklaus later remarked, "There are three lessons here, which have stuck with me ever since. First: Repair ball marks as you'd like the others to repair them for you. Second: Know the rules. Third: If in doubt, ask."<br><br>Now, not many of us have the "early success" of a Jack Nicklaus to help us do battle with the demon of fear on the golf course. But it should be at least slightly comforting that even the most accomplished major champion in the history of the game had at times his own struggles with fear. That is a sure illustration of just how destructive and pervasive fear can be.<br><br>In the context of golf, fear is a misplaced and wasted mind activity, but as worthless as it may be, left unchecked it will be crippling to your chances at success. Fear is a termite or a bark beetle or an ascaris worm. It lives inside the host, devouring it from the inside by living on what the host provides. Gruesome, insidious, perhaps, but it's a very effective means of shutting down a system and making it incapable of functioning. That's what happens to the golfer affected by fear. His whole process for shot-making can be turned on its head.<br><br>Try this thought experiment: Picture yourself standing on the tee box of a demanding golf hole. Let it be a hole you know well with a water hazard to carry and another down the right side of the fairway. In your mind, picture yourself addressing the ball and looking down the fairway. Visualize the sights, smells, and feel of the moment. Go through your whole preshot routine and setup. Then, just as you are at address and about to hit the ball, ask yourself the following question: "What if I slice?"<br><br>What happened? How did you feel the moment after asking yourself that question? Chances are, if you were deeply immersed in this little experiment, and if you are like most golfers, you felt a bolt of anxiety or fear shoot down your spine and maybe even into your stomach and hands. Chances are that you pictured the ball sailing off-line, and your mind filled with dreadful thoughts. In an instant, by asking yourself the simple question, "What if I slice?" you triggered your own anxiety and created your own fear. Excellence in golf requires that you make fearless swings at precise targets. Saying "What if I slice?" does not increase the likely success rate. By asking a bad question, you succumb to fear and put yourself at a disadvantage even before you've taken the club back.<br><br>As I've interviewed more and more golfers over the years, I've found that golfers go through a round of golf deep in a conversation with themselves. Sometimes this ongoing dialogue is about swing mechanics (we all remember watching the greats like Nick Faldo or Tiger Woods walking down the fairway making a practice swing trying to isolate a particular move in the downswing). Sometimes the internal conversation is about the golf course and its relative fairness. Sometimes the chatter is about the outcome of the next shot or the way the previous hole finished. The common thread that holds all these topics together is that golfers continually ask questions like these and that these bad questions can be a very destructive influence on the way you score. The fear-filled golfer asks the wrong questions. They are the wrong questions because they elicit a negative emotional reaction. They stall the process of moving toward success, and at their most detrimental actually move the golfer away from success.<br><br>Here's a quick lesson in who or what you're playing against: It was the most perfect spring day in a part of the world known for perfect spring days. It was Sunday at the 2002 Heritage of Golf Classic at Harbour Town Golf Links on the beautiful island of Hilton Head, South Carolina. The temperature was a comfortable eighty degrees, there was a soft breeze coming off Calibogue Sound, the fragrant cherry blossoms were in bloom, and golf fans came out by the thousands in their customary southern attire to watch and cheer for the best golfers in the world.<br><br>But the poetry and pageantry of the day were lost on the golfers themselves, particularly those in contention to win. For those golfers in the final groups, there was the prospect of a penalizing golf course to deal with. The same Calibogue breezes that were a blessing to the admiring spectators could gust at any moment and send a golf ball flying into the surrounding rough, bunkers, or salt marshes overgrown with sea oats. Standing between each man and victory was a supremely talented group of competitors, each of whom sought his own glory. On this gentle spring day, there were victories to be had, careers to be made, and for those who had left a bit of their soul at Augusta the week before, ghosts to be quieted.<br><br>The leaderboard consisted of golf's premier players, including Phil Mickelson, Davis Love III, Billy Andrade, and Heath Slocum. Young Justin Leonard led by three. On the practice range minutes before they were to tee off, Davis Love was committed to catching Justin Leonard: "I'm going to make a run at you!" he joked to his friend Justin. Having never played before a crowd that large, tour rookie Heath Slocum's mind was distracted by the large galleries, and the prospect of playing with the world's number two-ranked player, Phil Mickelson. Justin Leonard accepted the challenge of protecting the three-shot lead he'd built with the help of a blinding 64 on the second day of the tournament.<br><br>On the practice range minutes before he teed off, I put this question to Heath: "If the field is thinking about Justin, and Justin is thinking about his lead, and you are thinking about Phil, who do you suppose is thinking about the golf course?" Heath, whose success on tour was due as much to his quick mind as to his innate talent, immediately understood the point I was trying to make: You cannot play your best golf if your mind is preoccupied with thinking about other golfers. To play your best golf, your mind has to be focused exclusively on hitting shots at precise targets. So, on that glorious day in the spring of 2002, while a handful of golfers on the PGA Tour battled each other, Heath Slocum battled the golf course. And although his run at victory fell a stroke short, of all those in contention on Sunday, he shot the lowest final round score.<br>A rather unexpected but interesting pattern that emerged from my studies of golfers over the years had to do with the questions of mastery versus ego that golfers asked themselves; different questions that began a mental cycle leading either to fear or fearlessness. Understanding the import of this requires a short lesson on the workings of the mind, beginning with a thought experiment. For this experiment, take a moment and ask yourself four questions. Repeat these questions word for word to yourself and, after each one, pause a moment before moving on to the next:<br>1.What is the color of my car?<br>2.What animal produces milk?<br>3.Who is the best golfer in the world?<br>4.What are the colors of the American flag?<br>After reading each question, you no doubt pictured your car, you saw a cow, you pictured Tiger Woods or Jack Nicklaus, and you saw an image of an American flag. In other words, asking yourself questions immediately and powerfully triggered images in your mind. Though simple, this exercise illustrates three foundational mechanisms of human thinking. First, the mind automatically responds to the questions we ask ourselves. Second, the questions we ask ourselves determine where we focus our attention in the sense that, while you were asking those four questions, you were not thinking about politics, the Easter Bunny, or whether your garbage will be picked up on time. And third, the answers to the questions we ask ourselves often come back in visual form. I'd like you to hold on to those key points for the remainder of this chapter.<br><br>Certainly, we have all seen how fear makes cowards of us all, as the old expression goes. We all know that fear of public speaking is a tremendously common fear. Poor questions are often responsible for the cold feet that the betrothed feel on their wedding day. A client recently told me of her internal conversation on the morning of her wedding, when unlike anything she had ever done or thought before, she repeatedly asked poor questions of herself like, "What if he stops loving me?" She visualized future misery, and rather than concentrating on the beauty and joy of her wedding day, she was mired in a grip of panic and fear, barely making it through, let alone enjoying, her special day. Surely, we've all experienced a degree of fear of flying. Even though we know that statistically flying is safer than driving, we often can't help but ask ourselves, "What if the plane crashes?" Again, it is not a productive way of thinking. Much like if the mountain climber were suddenly to ask himself, "What if I fall?" Immediately, he is focused on not falling, instead of climbing and enjoying the challenge and the scenery. Self-induced anxiety and fear inhibits positive action.<br><br>Fear has its foundation in a focus on the future uncertainties of a particular moment, regardless of how absurd they might be. When you stand on the tee of a tight driving hole and immediately begin to think of a slice or a hook into trouble, why is that any different or more logical than wondering if your plane might crash or if your betrothed will stop loving you or if you will be unable to utter a sound when you have to give that presentation to all the department heads this afternoon? There isn't logic to it, especially if you let yourself fall victim to the cycle of unproductive self-questioning.<br><br>Fear begins and gets its fuel from the uncertainty of self-questioning. Most fear-inducing questions boil down to the same theme: What if I am faced with something terrible that I am not prepared for? But go deeper and it is just as easy to realize that this fear can fall away once we are willing to hear an answer to one of these moderately absurd questions. In nearly every case, the answer to a question of uncertainty is a simple, strong, positive question of its own: "What am I going to do about it?" When we ask ourselves "What if the plane crashes?" and we respond with "What am I going to do about it?" we are telling ourselves to look objectively at our particular uncertainty and deal with it thoroughly. In the case of fear of flying, for example, maybe it means reminding ourselves of the safety record of air travel, or even more simply, finding a way to deal with that uncomfortable moment of a flight (takeoff, let's say) by focusing on a process (reading a book, listening to music, closing your eyes and meditating) that takes our mind away from an absurd fear. You will see how that same sort of directed focus can make your next round of golf better, too.<br><b>words of a champion: tom kite, u.s. open 1992</b><br><br>Throughout his PGA Tour career, Tom Kite made himself into one of the most consistent performers the game has ever known. He once had twenty-one top tens in a season, and despite having only moderate physical gifts, he rose to number one on the all-time PGA Tour money list in the early 1990s. Kite did it with dedication and an indefatigable desire for improvement. For all that his career encompassed, his resume lacked that one crucial notation: a major championship. Kite shook loose that burden with a gritty performance on one of the toughest days in U.S. Open history. With winds whipping hard around Stillwater Cove and the tiny greens at Pebble Beach the consistency of a parking lot, Kite negotiated his way through 18 tough holes, the forty-mile-per-hour winds, and all the lingering doubters to win his first major title. After lifting the trophy, he said, "From tee to green, it was not even close to one of the best tournaments I've ever had. But as far as hanging in there and doing the things that were required on a very difficult golf course, this may have been the best."<br><br>Later, Kite told Golf Digest in an extended interview that there's a difference between recognizing fear and being afraid. The nerves will come out, he says, but that's what makes the moment supreme.<br><br>The thing that is difficult for people to appreciate is a lot of times when you see a guy that is coming down the stretch trying to win a golf tournament, he looks so calm and so collected and looks like he has everything under control.</p><h2>Convictions: How I Learned What Matters Most</h2><p><p>On the occasion of his seventieth birthday, the renowned scholar Marcus J. Borg shares how he formed his bedrock religious beliefs, contending that Christians in America are at their best when they focus on hope and transformation and so shows how we can return to what really matters most. The result is a manifesto for all progressive Christians who seek the best path for following Jesus today.</p><p>With each chapter embodying a distinct conviction, Borg writes provocatively and compellingly on the beliefs that can deeply ground us and guide us, such as: <em>God is real and a mystery; salvation is more about this life than an afterlife; the Bible can be true without being literally true; Jesus's death on the cross matters&#x2014;but not because he paid for our sins; God is passionate about justice and the poor; and to love God is to love like God.</em></p><p>Borg calls all American Christians to reject divisiveness and exclusivity and create communities that celebrate joy, possibility, and renewal.

The octopus turns out to be a very neighborly sort of octopus, helping the residents to wash their cars or weed the window boxes, and Nora makes fast friends with him. But one morning, the octopus is nowhere in sight. Has he moved on already? And just when Nora wanted to bring him for Show and Tell!</p><p>Lucy Branam grew up in Jacksboro, Tennessee, where she still resides. Roof Octopus is her first book.What could be more delightful than a huge and friendly octopus on the roof? That at least is the premise of Branam&#39;s debut which Coelho (Boat of Dreams, 2017) illuminates with views, usually canted or vertiginously angled, of a smiling, golden cephalopod hanging colorfully spotted tentacles down the sides of a city apartment building. Young Nora (brown-skinned like her parents and some of her neighbors and friends) is certainly wonderstruck when it taps on her bedroom window. Although the initial reactions of the grown-ups are a bit mixed (they all went on to work and school and tried not to make eye-contact with it), the way it lifts residents to their apartments, helps with small chores, and swings children back and forth soon wins everyone over. Her father&#39;s wonderful if seemingly witless suggestion that the genial giant might be making a migratory rest stop actually gains credence when it disappears after Nora murmurs something about bringing it to show-and-tell at school. But that Friday there&#39;s a tap...on her classroom window. Coelho&#39;s illustrations have the geometric look of Lane Smith&#39;s, higgledy-piggledy angles lending great energy to the proceedings. Even better than a crocodile in the bathtub. --Kirkus Reviews</p><h2>Texas! Lucky: A Novel (Texas!

She had come to the Christmas party at church reluctantly, hoping to find some peace and joy for her soul. But in the midst of her friends&#x2019; amiable banter, all she could hear were the words of her husband, Don. They were words that had cut her to the quick: &#x201c;You are so dull and stupid. I don&#x2019;t know why I ever married you.&#x201d;<br><br>Don was on one of his tears. Just last month he seemed to be doing better, trying harder and treating his wife better, but then things began to tense up. There had been a minor disagreement over a Christmas present, and from that point on, Don had seemed to become angrier and angrier. The man who just a few days before had vowed his love for her now was cursing her and raging at her. This man she loved but feared was almost destroying her.<br><br>It was so hard to put it all together. Her pensive look would have given her away if anyone had looked at her closely. Although she was among women who loved her and wanted to include her, she was on an island in her mind, trying to figure out why she felt so crazy.<br><br>Maybe you are like Sally. You understand what it means to be caught in the undertow of a relationship that seems to pull you down. Each time there is a lull in the tension, you tell yourself, <i>This time, everything is going to be all right.</i> Yet in a few hours or a few days, you are thrust into confusion again. Often you are blamed for whatever negative circumstances occur, and yet for the life of you you can&#x2019;t figure out why.<br><br>Sarah is a woman who was forced to look reality square in the face. &#x201c;My mother can be so much fun and a real friend in tough situations, if she wants to be. She is generous with my kids, and we look forward to her monthly visits.&#x201d;<br><br>Sarah tried to love her mother, Mary, but Mary had another side to her that baffled Sarah and everyone else. &#x201c;I guess you could say she has a major blind spot,&#x201d; Sarah explained. &#x201c;Everything will be going along fine, and then something happens to upset Mother. We never know what it will be; we just find out that she&#x2019;s upset. Her anger flares, and she has what my dad always called &#x2018;one of her three-day mad spells.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s had these so many times throughout my life that I have felt there was no hope. I&#x2019;ve figured that&#x2019;s just the way she is and I just have to live with her spells that throw us all off balance. What bothers me now, however, is that I&#x2019;ve seen her do the same thing to my children. She tells them, &#x2018;If you don&#x2019;t want to come stay with Granny, it&#x2019;s okay,&#x2019; but then she punishes them for not coming. She withdraws, and no one hears from her until she eventually calls. Then everything is fine again&#x2014; for a while.&#x201d;<br><br>Sarah&#x2019;s eyes filled with tears as she recalled a particularly painful incident with her mother. &#x201c;My daughter had a very rare form of cancer three years ago, when she was eight. Since my mother lives only an hour from us, she volunteered to stay at the house with my son while my husband and I were at the hospital. The afternoon after Mother arrived, she called the hospital room, demanding to know where I &#x2018;hid&#x2019; the mop. She wanted to clean my &#x2018;filthy&#x2019; kitchen floor. Since we were talking to the oncologist about the treatment plan for my daughter, I told Mother I would have to call her back. She insisted that I tell her right then where I put the mop! Sensing by my end of the conversation that she was pushing me, my husband took the phone and said, &#x2018;Mary, we will call you back later. The doctor is here, and we can&#x2019;t talk.&#x2019; Then he just hung up the phone.<br><br>&#x201c;When we got home that evening, Mother wasn&#x2019;t speaking. She never asked about her granddaughter but only made an announcement: &#x2018;I am leaving.&#x2019; I was too exhausted from the whole ordeal with my daughter to argue with her, so I just went to the bedroom and closed the door. I heard Mother say one last loud sentence to my husband before the front door slammed. &#x2018;Obviously,&#x2019; she said, &#x2018;my presence isn&#x2019;t needed.&#x2019; I didn&#x2019;t have the energy to stop her, and honestly, I didn&#x2019;t want to try. We had been through episodes like this before. I always found a way to smooth things over, to pack it all away and never mention it again until finally things would return to normal...if you can call that kind of relationship normal.<br><br>&#x201c;About three days later, Mother called and asked about my little girl as if she hadn&#x2019;t even been at our house. I was angry with her, but as usual, I told her what she wanted to hear, and I never brought up the incident again. There have been other incidents since then, and they&#x2019;re really starting to wear me out. My dad tried to reason with her for years about her &#x2018;mad spells,&#x2019; but he might as well have been talking to the wall. She refuses to even admit she has them much less be willing to change. She thinks she is just fine, and if people have a problem with her, well, it&#x2019;s just too bad. They are wrong, and if she&#x2019;s really mad, she calls them &#x2018;stupid&#x2019;!<br><br>&#x201c;I love my mother, and I want to be a good daughter. I don&#x2019;t want to be mean or act unchristian, but I just can&#x2019;t stand to walk on eggshells anymore. And I don&#x2019;t want my children to have to either. Something&#x2019;s got to change...but I&#x2019;m afraid it will never be Mother.&#x201d;<br><br>Sarah is describing the kind of complex, crazy-making relationship many of us experience sometime in our lives. Her mother, as generous and fun as she can sometimes be, has more than a blind spot. She has a dangerous character flaw that ensures that anyone who gets close to her will eventually be ensnared by her manipulation. Mary exhibits the behavior of one whom the Bible identifies as a <i>fool</i>. The reality is, relating to her will always involve emotional chaos.</p><h2>Marketing Analytics: Data-Driven Techniques with Microsoft Excel</h2><p><p><b>Helping tech-savvy marketers and data analysts solve real-world business problems with Excel</b></p> <p>Using data-driven business analytics to understand customers and improve results is a great idea in theory, but in today's busy offices, marketers and analysts need simple, low-cost ways to process and make the most of all that data.

The grifter class&#x2014;made up of the largest players in the financial industry and the politicians who do their bidding&#x2014;has been growing in power, and the crisis was only one terrifying manifestation of how they&#x2019;ve hijacked America&#x2019;s political and economic life.<br><br>Matt Taibbi has combined deep sources, trailblazing reportage, and provocative analysis to create the most lucid, emotionally galvanizing account yet written of this ongoing American crisis.

Women? Extra-horny older married men? Frequent Piedmont fliers?<br><br>I'm not sure what the endgame is here, but just going by the<br><br>McCain campaign's hilariously maladroit strategic performance so far, it can't be very sophisticated So I figure I'll catch a little of this cookie-cutter political stump act, snatch a few quotes for my magazine piece, then boogie to the exits and grab a cheesesteak on the way back to the hotel But will my car still be there when I get out? That's where my head is at, as Sarah Palin begins her speech.<br><br>Then I start listening.<br><br>She starts off reading her credentials She's got the kid and nephew in uniform-check Troop of milk-fed patriotic kiddies with Hallmark Channel names (a Bristol, a Willow, and a Piper, a rare Martin Mull-<br><br>caliber whiteness trifecta)-check Mute macho husband on a snow machine- check This is all standard-issue campaign decoration so far, but then she starts in with this thing about Harry Truman:<br><br>My parents are here tonight, and I am so proud to be the daughter of Chuck and Sally Heath Long ago, a young farmer and haberdasher from Missouri followed an unlikely path to the vice presidency.<br><br>A writer observed: "We grow good people in our small towns, with honesty, sincerity, and dignity." I know just the kind of people that writer had in mind when he praised Harry Truman.<br><br>I grew up with those people.<br><br>They are the ones who do some of the hardest work in America, who grow our food, run our factories, and fight our wars.<br><br>They love their country, in good times and bad, and they're always proud of America I had the privilege of living most of my life in a small town.<br><br>I'm on the floor for the speech-stuck in the middle of a bunch of delegates from, I believe, Colorado-and at the line "They are the ones who do some of the hardest work," the section explodes in cheers.<br><br>I look back up at Palin and she has a bit of a confident grin on her face now Not quite a smirk, that would be unfair to say, but she's oozing confidence after delivering these loaded lines From now through the end of her speech there will be a definite edge to her voice, an edge that also fills the air of this building.<br><br>Before I have any chance of noticing it she's moved beyond the speaking part of the program and is suddenly, effortlessly, deep into the signaling process, a place most politicians only reach with great effort, and clumsily, if at all But Palin is the opposite of clumsy: she's in the dog-whistle portion of the speech and doing triple lutzes and backflips.<br><br>She starts talking about her experience as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska:<br><br>I guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a "community organizer," except that you have actual responsibilities I might add that in small towns, we don't quite know what to make of a candidate who lavishes praise on working people when they are listening and then talks about how bitterly they cling to their religion and guns when those people aren't listening.<br><br>We tend to prefer candidates who don't talk about us one way in Scranton and another way in San Francisco.<br><br>The TV talking heads here will surely focus on the insult to Barack Obama and will miss the far more important part of this speech-the fact that Palin has moved from talking about small-town folks as They a few seconds ago to We now-We don't know what to make of this, We prefer this It doesn't take a whole lot of thought to figure out who this We is Certainly, to those listening, if you're part of this We, you know If you're not part of it, as I'm not, you know even more.<br><br>Sarah Palin's We is a very unusual character to make an appearance in a national presidential campaign, where candidates almost to the last tend to scrupulously avoid any hint that they are not talking to all Americans Inclusiveness, telegenic warmth, and inoffensiveness are the usual currency of national-campaign candidates Say as little as possible, hope some of the undecideds like your teeth better than the other guy's-that's usually the way this business works.<br><br>But Palin, boldly, has tossed all that aside: she is making an impassioned bunker speech to a highly self-aware We that defines itself by the enemies surrounding it, enemies Palin is by now haughtily rattling off one by one in this increasingly brazen and inspired address.<br><br>She's already gone after the "experts" and "pollsters and pundits" who dismissed McCain, the "community organizer" Obama, even the city of San Francisco (We are more likely to live in Scranton), but the more important bit came with the line about how people in small towns are the ones who "do some of the hardest work." The cheer at that line was one of recognition, because what Palin is clearly talking about there are the people this crowd thinks don't do "the hardest work," don't fight our wars, don't love our country.<br><br>And We know who They are.<br><br>What Palin is doing is nothing new It's a virtual copy of Dick Nixon's "forgotten Americans" gambit targeting the so-called silent<br><br>majority-the poor and middle-class suburban (and especially southern) whites who had stayed on the sidelines during the sixties culture wars That strategy won Nixon the election against Humphrey by stealing the South away from the Democrats and has been the cornerstone of Republican electoral planning ever since.<br><br>The strategy of stoking exurban white resentment against encroaching immigration, against the disappearance of old values, against pop- culture glitz, against government power, it all worked so well for the Republicans over the years that even Hillary Clinton borrowed it in her primary race against Obama.<br><br>Now Palin's We in St Paul is, in substance, no different from anything that half a dozen politicians before her have come up with But neither Nixon nor Hillary nor even Ronald Reagan-whose natural goofball cheerfulness blunted his ability to whip up divisive mobs-had ever executed this message with the political skill and magnetism of this suddenly metamorphosed Piedmont flight attendant at the Xcel Center lectern.<br><br>Being in the building with Palin that night is a transformative and oddly unsettling experience It's a little like having live cave-level access for the ripping-the-heart-out-with-the-bare-hands scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom A scary-as-hell situation: thousands of pudgy Midwestern conservatives worshipping at the Altar of the Economic Producer, led by a charismatic arch-priestess letting lose a grade-A war cry The clear subtext of Palin's speech is this: other politicians only talk about fighting these assholes, I actually will.<br><br>Palin is talking to voters whose country is despised internationally, no longer an industrial manufacturing power, fast becoming an economic vassal to the Chinese and the Saudis, and just a week away from an almost-total financial collapse Nobody here is likely to genuinely believe a speech that promises better things.<br><br>But cultural civil war, you have that no matter how fucking broke you are And if you want that, I, Sarah Palin, can give it to you It's a powerful, galvanizing speech, but the strange thing about it is its seeming lack of electoral calculation It's a transparent attempt to mass-<br><br>market militancy and frustration, consolidate the group identity of an aggrieved demographic, and work that crowd up into a lather This represents a further degrading of the already degraded electoral process Now, not only are the long-term results of elections irrelevant, but for a new set of players like Palin, the outcome of the election itself is irrelevant This speech wasn't designed to win a general election, it was designed to introduce a new celebrity, a make- believe servant of the people so phony that later in her new career she will not even bother to hold an elective office.<br><br>The speech was a tremendous success On my way out of the building I'm stuck behind a pair of delegates who are joyously rehashing Palin's money quotes:<br><br>BUTT-HEAD: You know what they say the difference is between a hockey mom and a pit bull?<br><br>BEAVIS: Yeah.<br><br>BUTT-HEAD: No, I mean, you remember?<br><br>BEAVIS: Oh, yeah!<br><br>BUTT-HEAD: She's like, "Lipstick!"<br><br>BEAVIS: Yeah, lipstick! (both explode in laughter)<br><br>I reach out and tap one of them on the shoulder.<br><br>"Hey," I say "Can I ask you two what you think Sarah Palin will actually accomplish, if she gets elected?"<br><br>Beavis stares at me "I think she's gonna take America back,"<br><br>he says.<br><br>Getting this kind of answer on campaign jaunts is like asking someone why they like Pepsi and having them answer, "Because I believe it's the choice of a new generation."<br><br>"Yeah, okay," I say "But what actual policies do you want her to enact, or what laws do you think she's going to pass?"<br><br>They both frown and glance down at my press pass, and I realize instantly the game is up I'm not part of the We Butt-Head steps forward in a defensive posture, shielding his buddy from the liberal- media Ausl�nder.<br><br>"Wait a minute," he says "Who do you work for, exactly?"<br><br>The big difference between America and the third world: in America, our leaders put on a hell of a show for us voters, while in the third world, the bulk of the population gets squat In the third world, most people know where they stand and don't have any illusions about it.<br><br>Maybe they get a parade every now and then, get to wave at shock troops carrying order colors in an eyes-right salute Or maybe, if they're lucky, the leader will spring for a piece of mainstream entertainment-he'll host a heavyweight title fight at the local Palace of Beheading Something that puts the country on the map, cheers the national mood, distracts folks from their status as barefoot scrapers of the bottom of the international capitalist barrel.<br><br>But mostly your third-world schmuck gets the shaft He gets to live in dusty, unpaved dumps, eat expired food, scratch and claw his way to an old enough age to reproduce, and then die unnecessarily of industrial accidents, malnutrition, or some long-forgotten disease of antiquity Meanwhile, drawing upon the collective whole-life economic output of this worthy fellow and 47 million of his fellow citizens, the leader and about eighteen of his luckiest friends get to live in villas in Ibiza or the south of France, with enough money for a couple of impressive-looking ocean cruisers and a couple dozen sports cars.<br><br>We get more than that in America We get a beautifully choreographed eighteen-month entertainment put on once every four years, a beast called the presidential election that engrosses the population to the point of obsession This ongoing drama allows everyone to subsume their hopes and dreams for the future into one all-out, all-or-nothing battle for the White House, a big alabaster symbol of power we see on television a lot Who wins and who loses this contest is a matter of utmost importance to a hell of a lot of people in this country.<br><br>But why it's so important to them is one of the great unexplored mysteries of our time It's a mystery rooted in the central, horrifying truth about our national politics.<br><br>Which is this: none of it really matters to us The presidential election is a drama that we Americans have learned to wholly consume as entertainment, divorced completely from any expectations about concrete changes in our own lives For the vast majority of people who follow national elections in this country, the payoff they're looking for when they campaign for this or that political figure is that warm and fuzzy feeling you get when the home team wins the big game Or, more importantly, when a hated rival loses Their stake in the electoral game isn't a citizen's interest, but a rooting interest.<br><br>Voters who throw their emotional weight into elections they know deep down inside won't produce real change in their lives are also indulging in a find of fantasy That's why voters still dream of politicians whose primary goal is to effectively govern and maintain a thriving first world society with great international ambitions What voters don't realize, or don't want to reali...</p><h2>The Timber Press Guide to Vegetable Gardening in the Midwest (Regional Vegetable Gardening Series)</h2><p><b>How to grow your own food in the Heartland!</b><br><br> There is nothing more regionally specific than vegetable gardening&#x2014;what to plant, when to plant it, and when to harvest are decisions based on climate, weather, and first frost.&nbsp;<i>The Timber Press Guide to Vegetable Gardening in the Midwest</i>, by regional expert Michael VanderBrug, focuses on the unique eccentricities of the Midwest gardening calendar.

Berlin, a city where nothing is verboten. In the night streets, political gangs wander, looking for fights. Daylight reveals a beleaguered populace barely recovering from the postwar inflation, often jobless, reeling from the reparations imposed by the victors. At central police HQ, the Murder Commission has its hands full. A killer is on the loose, and though he scatters many clues, each is a dead end. It's almost as if he is taunting the cops. Meanwhile, the press is having a field day. <br><br>This is what Bernie Gunther finds on his first day with the Murder Commisson. He's been taken on beacuse the people at the top have noticed him--they think he has the makings of a first-rate detective. But not just yet. Right now, he has to listen and learn. <br><br><i>Metropolis</i> is a tour of a city in chaos: of its seedy sideshows and sex clubs, of the underground gangs that run its rackets, and its bewildered citizens--the lost, the homeless, the abandoned. It is Berlin as it edges toward the new world order that Hitler will soo usher in. And Bernie? He's a quick study and he's learning a lot. Including, to his chagrin, that when push comes to shove, he isn't much better than the gangsters in doing whatever her must to get what he wants.</p><p><b>Philip Kerr </b>was the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the acclaimed Bernie Gunther novels, three of whichwere finalists for the Edgar Award for Best Novel. Kerr has also won several Shamus Awards and the British Crime Writers' Association Ellis Peters Award for Historical Crime Fiction. Just before his death in 2018, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. As P. B. Kerr, he is the author of the much-loved young adult fantasy series Children of the Lamp.<p>Five days after the federal general election, Bernhard Weiss, Berlin's chief of the Criminal Police, summoned me to a meeting in his sixth-floor office at the Alex. Wreathed in the smoke from one of his favorite Black Wisdom cigars and seated at the conference table alongside Ernst Gennat, one of his best homicide detectives, he invited me to sit down. Weiss was forty-eight years old and a Berliner, small, slim, and dapper, academic even, with round glasses and a neat, well-trimmed mustache. He was also a lawyer and a Jew, which made him unpopular with many of our colleagues, and he'd overcome a great deal of prejudice to get where he was: in peacetime, Jews had been forbidden to become officers in the Prussian Army; but when war broke out, Weiss applied to join the Royal Bavarian Army, where he quickly rose to the rank of captain and won an Iron Cross. After the war, at the request of the Ministry of the Interior, he'd reformed the Berlin police and made it one of the most modern forces in Europe. Still, it had to be said, he made an unlikely-looking policeman; he always reminded me a little of Toulouse-Lautrec.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was a file open in front of him and from the look of it, the subject was me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You've been doing a good job in Vice," he said in his plummy, almost thespian voice. "Although I fear you're fighting a losing battle against prostitution in this city. All these war widows and Russian refugees make a living as best they can. I keep telling our leaders that if we did more to support equal pay for women we could solve the problem of prostitution in Berlin overnight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"But that's not why you're here. I expect you've heard: Heinrich Lindner has left the force to become an air traffic controller at Tempelhof, which leaves a spare seat in the murder wagon."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, sir."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Do you know why he left?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I did know, but hardly wanting to say, I found myself pulling a face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You can say. I shan't be in the least offended."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'd heard it said he didn't like taking orders from a Jew, sir."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That's correct, Gunther. He didn't like taking orders from a Jew." Weiss drew on his cigar. "What about you? Do you have any problems taking orders from a Jew?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No, sir."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Or in taking orders from anyone else, for that matter."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No, sir. I have no problem with authority."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm delighted to hear it. Because we're thinking of offering you a permanent seat in the wagon. Lindner's seat."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Me, sir?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You sound surprised."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Only that it's the splash around the Alex that Inspector Reichenbach was going to get the seat."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Not unless you turn it down. And even then I have my doubts about that man. Of course, people will say I don't dare offer the seat to another Jew. But that's not it at all. In our opinion you've the makings of a fine detective, Gunther. You are diligent and you know when to keep your mouth shut; that's good in a detective. Very good. Kurt Reichenbach is a good detective, too, but he's rather free with his fists. When he was still in uniform, some of his brother police officers nicknamed him Siegfried, on account of the fact that he was much too fond of wielding his sword. Of hitting some of our customers with the handle or the flat of the blade. I don't mind what an officer does in the name of self-defense. But I won't have a police officer cracking heads open for the pleasure of it. No matter whose head it is."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"And he hasn't stopped for the lack of a sword," said Gennat. "More recently there was a rumor he beat up an SA man he'd arrested in Lichtenrade, a Nazi who'd stabbed a communist. Nothing was proven. He might be popular around the Alex-even some of the anti-Semites seem to like him-but he's got a temper."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Precisely. I'm not saying he's a bad policeman. Just that we think we prefer you to him." Weiss looked down at the page in my file. "I see you made your Abitur. But no university."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The war. I volunteered."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"So then. You want the seat? It's yours if you do."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, sir. Very much."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You've been attached to the Murder Commission before, of course. So you've already worked a murder, haven't you? Last year. In Sch&#x161;neberg, wasn't it? As you know, I like all my detectives to have had the experience of working a homicide alongside a top man like Gennat here."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Which makes me wonder why you think I'm worth the permanent seat," I said. "That case-the Frieda Ahrendt case-has gone cold."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Most cases go cold for a while," said Gennat. "And it's not just cases that go cold, it's detectives, too. Especially in this city. Never forget that. It's just the nature of the job. New thinking is the key to solving cold cases. As a matter of fact, I've got some other cases you can check out if you ever get such a thing as a quiet moment. Cold cases are what can make a detective's reputation."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Frieda Ahrendt," said Weiss. "Remind me of that one."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"A dog found some body parts wrapped in brown paper and buried in the Gr&#x178;newald," I said. "And it was Hans Schnieckert and the boys in Division J who first identified her. On account of the fact that the killer was thoughtful enough to leave us her hands. The dead girl's fingerprints revealed she had a record for petty theft. You would think that might have opened a lot of doors. But we've found no family, no job, not even a last-known address. And because a newspaper was foolish enough to put up a substantial reward for information, we wasted a lot of time interviewing members of the public who were more interested in making a thousand reichsmarks than in helping the police. At least four women told us their husbands were the culprit. One of them even suggested her husband was originally going to cook the body parts. Thus the newspaper epithet: the Gr&#x178;newald Pork Butcher."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That's one way to get rid of your old man," said Gennat. "Put him up for a murder. Cheaper than getting a divorce."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After Bernhard Weiss, Ernst Gennat was the most senior detective in the Alex; he was also the largest, nicknamed the Big Buddha; it was a tight fit in the station wagon with Gennat on board. Weiss himself had designed the murder wagon. It was equipped with a radio, a small fold-down desk with a typewriter, a medical kit, lots of photographic equipment, and almost everything needed to investigate a homicide except a prayer book and a crystal ball. Gennat had a mordant Berlin wit, the result, he said, of having been born and brought up in the staff quarters at Berlin's Pl&#x161;tzensee Prison, where his father had been the assistant governor. It was even rumored that on execution days Gennat had breakfasted with the headsman. Early in my days at the Alex, I'd decided to study the man and make him my model.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The telephone rang and Weiss answered it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You're SPD, right, Gunther?" Gennat asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That's right."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Because we don't need any politics in the wagon. Communists, Nazism, I get enough of that at home. And you're single, right?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Good. Because this job ruins a marriage. You might look at me and think, not unreasonably, that I'm very popular with the ladies. But only until I get a case that keeps me here at the Alex day and night. I'll need to find a nice lady copper if ever I'm going to get married. So where do you live?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I rent a room in a boardinghouse on Nollendorfplatz."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"This job means a bit more money and a promotion and maybe a better room. In that order. And you'll be on probation for a month or two. Does this house you live in have a telephone?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Use drugs?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ever try them?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Bit of cocaine once. To see what all the fuss was about. Not for me. Besides, I couldn't afford it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No harm in that, I suppose," said Gennat. "There's still a lot of pain relief this country needs after the war."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"A lot of people aren't taking it for pain relief," I said. "Which sometimes leaves them with a very different kind of crisis."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"There are some people who think the Berlin police are in crisis," said Gennat. "Who think the whole city is in crisis. What do you think, lad?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The larger the city, the more crises there are likely to be. I think we're always going to be facing a crisis of one kind or another. Might as well get used to that. It's indecision that's more likely to cause us crises. Governments that can't get anything done. With no clear majority, I'm not sure this new one will be any different. Right now our biggest problem looks like democracy itself. What use is it when it can't deliver a viable government? It's the paradox of our times and sometimes I worry that we will get tired of it before it can sort itself out."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He nodded, seeming to agree with me, and moved on to another issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Some politicians don't think much of our clear-up rate. What do you say to that, lad?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"They should come and meet some of our clients. Maybe if the dead were a bit more talkative they'd have a fair point."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It's our job to hear them all the same," said Gennat. He shifted his enormous bulk for a moment and then stood up. It was like watching a zeppelin get airborne. The floor creaked as he walked to the corner turret window. "If you listen closely enough you can still hear them whisper. Like these Winnetou murders. I figure his victims are talking to us, but we just haven't understood what language they're speaking." He pointed out the window at the metropolis. "But someone does. Someone down there, perhaps coming out of Hermann Tietz. Maybe Winnetou himself."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Weiss finished his telephone call and Gennat came back to the meeting table, where he lit his own pungent cigar. By now there was quite a cloudscape drifting across the table. It reminded me of gas drifting across no-man's-land.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was too nervous to light a cigarette myself. Too nervous and too respectful of my seniors; I was still in awe of them and amazed that they wanted me to be part of their team.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That was the ViPoPra," said Weiss.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The ViPoPra was the police president of Berlin, Karl Z&#x161;rgiebel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It seems that the Wolfmium light-bulb factory in Stralau just blew up. First reports say there are many dead. Perhaps as many as thirty. He'll keep us posted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I would remind you that we are agreed not to use the name Winnetou when we're referring to our scalping murderer. I think it does those poor dead girls a grave disservice to use these sensationalized names. Let's stick to the file name, shall we, Ernst? Silesian Station. Better for security that way."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Sorry, sir. Won't happen again."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"So welcome to the Murder Commission, Gunther. The rest of your life just changed forever. You'll never look at people in the same way again. From now on, whenever you stand next to a man at a bus stop or on a train, you'll be sizing him up as a potential killer. And you'd be right to do so. Statistics show that most murders in Berlin are committed by ordinary, law-abiding citizens. In short, people like you and me. Isn't that right, Ernst?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, sir. It's rare I ever meet a murderer who looks like one."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You'll see things every bit as bad as the things you saw in the trenches," he added. "Except that some of the victims will be women and children. But we have to be hard. And you'll find we tend to make jokes most people wouldn't find funny."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, sir."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What do you know about these Silesian Station killings, Gunther?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Four local prostitutes murdered in as many weeks. Always at night. The first one near Silesian Station. All of them hit over the head with a ball-peen hammer and then scalped with a very sharp knife. As if by the eponymous Red Indian from Karl May's famous novels."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Which you've read, I trust."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Show me a German who hasn't and I'll show you a man who can't read."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Enjoy it?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Well, it's been a few years-but yes."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Good. I couldn't like a man who didn't like a good western by Karl May. What else do you know? About the murders, I mean."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Not much." I shook my head. "Chances are the killer didn't know the victims, which makes him hard to catch. It may be the instinct of the moment that drives his actions."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, yes," said Weiss, as if he'd heard all this before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The killings do seem to be having an effect on the number of girls on the streets," I said. "There are fewer prostitutes about than there used to be. The ones I've spoken to tell me they're scared to work."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Anything else?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Well-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Weiss shot me a quizzical look. "Spit it out, man. Whatever it is. I expect all my detectives to speak frankly."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Just that the working girls have another name for these women. Because they were scalped. When the last woman was murdered I started hearing her described as another Pixavon Queen." I paused. "Like the shampoo, sir."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, I have heard of Pixavon shampoo. As the ads would have it, a shampoo used by 'good wives and mothers.' A bit of street corner irony. Anything else?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Nothing really. Only what's in the newspapers. My landlady, Frau Weitendorf, has been following the case quite closely. As you might expect, given how lurid the facts are. She loves a good murder. We're all obliged to listen to her while she brings us our breakfast. Hardly the most appetizing of subjects, but there it is."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm interested: What does she have to say about it?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I paused, picturing Frau Weitendorf in her usual vocal flow, full of an almost righteous indignation and hardly seeming to care if any of her lodgers were paying attention. Large, with ill-fitting dentures, and two bulldogs that stayed close to her heels, she was one of those women who liked to talk, with or without an audience. The long-sleeved quilted peignoir she wore at breakfast made her look like a grubby Chinese emperor, an effect that was enhanced by her double chins.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Besides Weitendorf, there were four of us in the house: an Englishman called Robert Rankin who claimed to be a writer; a Bavarian Jew by the name of Fischer who said he was a traveling salesman, but was probably a crook of some kind; and a young woman named Rosa Braun who played the saxophone in a dance band but was almost certainly a half-silk. Including Frau Weitendorf, we were an unlikely quintet, but perhaps a perfect cross section of modern Berlin.</p></p><h2>Mothering Sunday: A Romance (Vintage International)</h2><p>On an unseasonably warm spring day in 1924, twenty-two-year-old Jane Fairchild, a maid at an English country house, meets with her secret lover, the young heir of a neighboring estate. He is about to be married to a woman more befitting his social status, and the time has come to end the affair&#x2014;but events unfold in ways Jane could never have predicted. <br> &nbsp;<br> As the narrative moves back and forth across the twentieth century, what we know and understand about Jane&#x2014;about the way she loves, thinks, feels, sees, and remembers&#x2014;expands with every page. In <i>Mothering Sunday</i>, Booker Prize-winning novelist Graham Swift has crafted an emotionally soaring and profoundly moving work of fiction.</p><p>Graham Swift was born in 1949 and is the author of ten novels; two collections of short stories; and <i>Making an Elephant,</i> a book of essays, portraits, poetry and reflections on his life in writing. With <i>Waterland</i> he won The Guardian Fiction Award, and with <i>Last Orders</i> the Booker Prize. Both novels have since been made into films. His work has appeared in more than thirty<br> languages.ONCE UPON A TIME,&nbsp;before the boys were killed and when there were more horses than cars, before the male servants disappeared and they made do, at Upleigh and at Beechwood, with just a cook and a maid, the Sheringhams had owned not just four horses in their own stable, but what might be called a &#x201c;real horse,&#x201d; a racehorse, a thoroughbred. Its name was Fandango. It was stabled near Newbury. It had never won a damn thing. But it was the family&#x2019;s indulgence, their hope for fame and glory on the racecourses of southern England. The deal was that Ma and Pa&#x2014;otherwise known in his strange language as &#x201c;the shower&#x201d;&#x2014;owned the head and body and he and Dick and Freddy had a leg each.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What about the fourth leg?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh the fourth leg. That was always the question.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> For most of the time it was just a name, never seen, though an expensively quartered and trained name. It had been sold in 1915&#x2014;when he&#x2019;d been fifteen too. &#x201c;Before you showed up, Jay.&#x201d; But once, long ago, early one June morning, they&#x2019;d all gone, for the strange, mad expedition of it, just to watch it, just to watch Fandango, their horse, being galloped over the downs. Just to stand at the rail and watch it, with other horses, thundering towards them, then flashing past. He and Ma and Pa and Dick and Freddy. And&#x2014;who knows?&#x2014;some other ghostly interested party who really owned the fourth leg.<br> &nbsp;<br> He had a hand on her leg.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the only time she&#x2019;d known his eyes go anything close to misty. And she&#x2019;d had the clear sharp vision (she would have it still when she was ninety) that she might have gone with him&#x2014;might still somehow miraculously go with him, just him&#x2014;to stand at the rail and watch Fandango hurtle past, kicking up the mud and dew. She had never seen such a thing but she could imagine it, imagine it clearly. The sun still coming up, a red disc, over the grey downs, the air still&nbsp;crisp and cold, while he shared with her, perhaps, a silver-capped hip flask and, not especially stealthily, clawed her arse.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> BUT SHE WATCHED&nbsp;him now move, naked but for a silver signet ring, across the sunlit room. She would not later in life use with any readiness, if at all, the word &#x201c;stallion&#x201d; for a man. But such he was. He was twenty-three and she was twenty-two. And he was even what you might call a thoroughbred, though she did not have that word then, any more than she had the word &#x201c;stallion.&#x201d; She did not yet have a million words. Thoroughbred: since it was &#x201c;breeding&#x201d; and &#x201c;birth&#x201d; that counted with his kind. Never mind to what actual purpose.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was March 1924. It wasn&#x2019;t June, but it was a day like June. And it must have been a little after noon. A window was flung open, and he walked, unclad, across the sun-filled room as carelessly as any unclad animal. It was his room, wasn&#x2019;t it? He could do what he liked in it. He clearly could. And she had never been in it before, and never would be again.<br> &nbsp;<br> And she was naked too.<br> &nbsp;<br> March 30th 1924. Once upon a time. The shadows from the latticework in the window slipped over him like foliage. Having gathered up the cigarette case and lighter and a little silver ashtray from the dressing table, he turned, and there, beneath a nest of dark hair and fully bathed by sunshine, were his cock and balls, mere floppy and still sticky appendages. She could look at them if she liked, he didn&#x2019;t mind.<br> &nbsp;<br> But then he could look at her. She was stretched out naked, except for a pair&#x2014;her only pair&#x2014;of very cheap earrings. She hadn&#x2019;t pulled up the sheet. She had even clasped her hands behind her head the better to look at him. But he could look at her. Feast your eyes. It was an expression that came to her. Expressions had started to come to her. Feast your eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Outside, all Berkshire stretched out too, girded with bright greenery, loud with birdsong, blessed in March with a day in June.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was still a follower of horses. That is, he still threw money away on them. It was his version of economising, to throw money away. For nearly eight years he&#x2019;d had money for three, in theory. He called it &#x201c;loot.&#x201d; But he would show he could do without it. And what the two of them had been doing for almost seven years cost, as he would sometimes remind her, absolutely nothing. Except secrecy and risk and cunning and a mutual aptitude for being good at it.<br> &nbsp;<br> But they had never done anything like this. She had never been in this bed before&#x2014;it was a single bed, but roomy. Or in this room, or in this house. If it cost nothing, then this was the greatest of gifts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Though if it cost nothing, she might always remind him, then what about the times when he&#x2019;d given her sixpences? Or was it even threepences? When it was only just beginning, before it got&#x2014;was it the right word?&#x2014;serious. But she would never dare remind him. And not now anyway. Or dare throw at him the word &#x201c;serious.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He sat on the bed beside her. He ran a hand across her belly as if brushing away invisible dust. Then he arranged on it the lighter and ashtray, retaining the cigarette case. He took two cigarettes from the case, putting one in her own proffered, pouting lips. She had not taken her hands from the back of her head. He lit hers, then his. Then, gathering up the case and lighter to put on the bedside table, he stretched out beside her, the ashtray still positioned halfway between her navel and what these days he would happily, making no bones about it, call her &#x201c;cunt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Cock, balls, cunt. There were some simple, basic expressions.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was March 30th. It was a Sunday. It was what used to be known as Mothering Sunday.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;WELL,&nbsp;you have a gorgeous day for it, Jane,&#x201d; Mr. Niven had said as she brought in fresh coffee and toast.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said and she&#x2019;d wondered quite what he meant by &#x201c;it&#x201d; in her case.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A truly gorgeous day.&#x201d; As if it were something he had generously provided. And then to Mrs. Niven, &#x201c;You know, if someone had told us it was going to be like this, we might as well have all packed hampers. A picnic&#x2014;by the river.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He said it wistfully, yet eagerly, so that, putting down the toast rack, she&#x2019;d thought for an instant there might actually be a change of plan and she and Milly would be required to pack a hamper. Wherever the hamper&nbsp;<i>was</i>, and whatever they were supposed to put in it at such inconsiderate notice. This being&nbsp;<i>their</i>&nbsp;day.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then Mrs. Niven had said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s March, Godfrey,&#x201d; with a distrusting glance towards the window.<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, she&#x2019;d been wrong. The day had only got better.<br> &nbsp;<br> And anyway the Nivens had their plan, on which the weather could only smile. They were to drive to Henley to meet the Hobdays and the Sheringhams. Given their common predicament&#x2014;which only occurred once a year and only for a portion of one day&#x2014;they were all to meet for lunch at Henley and so deal with the temporary bother of having no servants.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the Hobdays&#x2019; idea&#x2014;or invitation. Paul Sheringham was to marry Emma Hobday in just two weeks&#x2019; time. So the Hobdays had suggested to the Sheringhams an outing for lunch: an opportunity to toast and talk over the forthcoming event, as well as a solution to Sunday&#x2019;s practical difficulty. And then because the Nivens were close friends and neighbours of the Sheringhams and would be honoured guests at the wedding (and would have the same difficulty), the Nivens&#x2014;as Mr. Niven had put it to her when first notifying her of these arrangements&#x2014;had been &#x201c;roped in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> This had all made clear one thing she knew already. Whatever else Paul Sheringham was marrying, he was marrying money. Perhaps he had to, the way he got through his own. The Hobdays would be paying in two weeks&#x2019; time for a grand wedding, and did you really need to celebrate a forthcoming celebration? Not unless you had plenty to spare. It might demand nothing less than champagne. When Mr. Niven had mentioned the hamper he had perhaps been wondering how much the Hobdays&#x2019; liberality could be relied on or how much the day might involve his own pocket.<br> &nbsp;<br> But that the Hobdays had plenty to spare pleased her. It had nothing to do with her, but it pleased her. That Emma Hobday might be made of five-pound notes, that the marriage might be an elaborate way of obtaining &#x201c;loot,&#x201d; pleased or, rather, consoled her. It was all the other things it might entail that&#x2014;even as Mr. Niven explained about the &#x201c;roping in&#x201d;&#x2014;gnawed at her.<br> &nbsp;<br> And would Mister Paul and Miss Hobday be joining the party themselves? She couldn&#x2019;t really ask it directly, vital as it was to her to know. And Mr. Niven didn&#x2019;t volunteer the information.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Would you mention these arrangements to Milly? None of it of course need affect&#x2014;your own arrangements.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was not often that he had the occasion to say such a thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A jamboree in Henley, Jane. A meeting of the tribes. Let&#x2019;s hope we have the weather for it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She wasn&#x2019;t quite sure what &#x201c;jamboree&#x201d; meant, though she felt she had read the word somewhere. But &#x201c;jam&#x201d; suggested something jolly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I hope so too, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> AND NOW&nbsp;they clearly had the weather for it, and Mr. Niven, whatever his earlier misgivings, was indeed getting rather jolly. He was going&nbsp;to be driving himself. He had already announced that they might as well set off soon, so they could &#x201c;pootle around&#x201d; and take advantage of such a lovely morning. He wouldn&#x2019;t, apparently, be calling on Alf at the garage, who&#x2014;for the right sum&#x2014;could become a convincing chauffeur. In any case, as she&#x2019;d observed over recent years, Mr. Niven liked driving. He even preferred the pleasure of driving to the dignity of being driven. It gave him a boyish zest. And as he was always saying, with a whole variety of intonations, ranging from bluster to lament, times were changing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once upon a time, after all, the Nivens would have met the Sheringhams at Sunday service.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tribes&#x201d; had suggested something hot and outdoors. She knew it was to be the George Hotel in Henley. It was not to be a picnic. And it might well have been a day, since it was still March, of evil gales, even snow. But it was a morning like a morning in summer. And Mrs. Niven left the table to go up to get herself ready.<br> &nbsp;<br> She couldn&#x2019;t ask, even now with Mr. Niven conveniently alone, &#x201c;Would Miss Hobday and...?&#x201d; Even if it sounded like just a maid&#x2019;s idle curiosity. Wasn&#x2019;t the coming wedding the only current talking-point? And she certainly couldn&#x2019;t ask, &#x201c;If not, then what other separate arrangements might the two of them have in mind?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She didn&#x2019;t think that if she were one half of a betrothed couple&#x2014;or at least Paul Sheringham&#x2019;s half&#x2014;she would want, two weeks before their wedding, to attend a jamboree in Henley to be fussed over by the older generation (by what he might have called&#x2014;she could see him speaking with a cigarette in his mouth and wincingly screwing up his eyes&#x2014;&#x201c;three bloody showers together&#x201d;).<br> &nbsp;<br> But in any case, if she got no further information, it still left the problem that was peculiarly hers on this day, as Mr. Niven knew, of what to do with it. Today it was painfully peculiar. The gorgeous weather didn&#x2019;t necessarily help at all. It only seemed&#x2014;with two weeks to go&#x2014;to deepen a shadow.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was going to say to Mr. Niven, when the moment came, that if he&#x2014;if he and Mrs. Niven&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t mind, she might not &#x201c;go&#x201d; anywhere. She might just stay here at Beechwood and read a book if that was all right&#x2014;&#x201c;her book&#x201d; as she might put it, though it belonged to Mr. Niven. She might just sit somewhere in the sunshine in the garden.<br> &nbsp;<br> She knew that Mr. Niven could only approve of such a harmless suggestion. He might even think it was a rather appealing image. And of course it would mean she&#x2019;d be ready to resume her duties at once, whenever they returned. She could find something to eat in the kitchen. Milly, before she left, might even make her a sandwich. She could have her own &#x201c;picnic.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And it might even have happened just like that. The bench in the nook by the sundial. Bumblebees tricked by the weather. The magnolia tree already loaded with blossom. Her book on her lap. She knew which book it would be.<br> &nbsp;<br> So&#x2014;she would put the idea to Mr. Niven.<br> &nbsp;<br> But then the telephone had rung and&#x2014;it being one of her numberless duties&#x2014;she&#x2019;d hastened to answer it. And her heart had soared. That was a phrase you read in books, but it was sometimes actually true of what happened to people. It was true then of herself. Her heart had soared, like some stranded heroine&#x2019;s in a story. Like the larks she would hear in a little while, trilling and soaring high in the blue sky, as she pedalled her way to Upleigh.<br> &nbsp;<br> But she&#x2019;d been careful to say, quite loudly, into the receiver and with her best answering-the-telephone voice that was both maid-like and somewhat queenly, &#x201c;Yes, madam.&#x201d;</p><h2>Paper: Paging Through History</h2><p><p><strong>From the <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author of <em>Cod</em> and <em>Salt</em>, a definitive history of paper and the astonishing ways it has shaped today&#x2019;s world.</strong></p><p>Paper is one of the simplest and most essential pieces of human technology.

The cult became a worldwide phenomenon in 1975 when there was a massacre including the death of its infamous leader, Sister Katherine. Kyle's brief is to explore the paranormal myths surrounding an organization that became a testament to paranoia, murderous rage, and occult rituals. The shoot's locations take him to the cult's first temple in London, an abandoned farm in France, and a derelict copper mine in the Arizonan desert where The Temple of the Last Days met its bloody end. But when he interviews those involved in the case, those who haven't broken silence in decades, a series of uncanny events plague the shoots. Troubling out-of-body experiences, nocturnal visitations, the sudden demise of their interviewees and the discovery of ghastly artifacts in their room make Kyle question what exactly it is the cult managed to awaken &#x2013; and what is its interest in him?</p></p><p><b>Adam Nevill&nbsp;</b>(aka Adam L.

The smile vanished from Maximillian Solomon's eyes when he asked the question; a sign of self-seriousness, or a sudden scrutiny of Kyle's fitness for disclosure; something Kyle noticed about mind, body and spirit types who spoke about their interests with strangers. Ufologists and mediums were the same. But even though Solomon's eyes hardened, the small tanned face of the CEO of Revelation Productions retained its default setting of being vaguely amused. With Kyle. Or maybe with everyone in the world except himself. The permanent half-smile was either convivial or mocking. It was hard to tell which with <i>these people</i>: the successful, the owners of things, the commissioners and controllers he'd dealt with as a film-maker. 'Yes,' Kyle said, and then his mind snatched at what he did know about Sister Katherine and The Temple of the Last Days. Fragments resembling instamatic polaroid photos: sun-bleached flashes of a scruffy, bearded man in handcuffs, walking from a police car and into a municipal building;aerial footage of what might have been a ranch or a farm in ... California? Snippets of imagery from something about the cult he'd seen on telly a long time ago. A documentary, or was it news footage? He wasn't sure of the source of the impressions, but they were glimpses of things that suggested a notoriety that had evolved into the noir and the cultish. He knew that much; the group was perceived these days as dangerous and cool. A US Indie band called itself Sister Katherine in the eighties; some industrial band called itself The Temple of the Last Days in the next decade. And of course, he'd recognize the iconic portrait of Sister Katherine anywhere without knowing much about her life; it had been Andy Warholed on to T-shirts in Camden Market, alongside images of Jim Jones and Charles Manson, Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees. A plump, heavily made-up face, its expression beatific, haloed by a purple nun's habit as her eyes searched the heavens. Mother Mary meets Revlon. An evil female cult leader reduced to sick joke gimmickry, lurid nostalgia, and bespoke infamy for disaffected youth. A woman who was killed by ... or did she commit suicide with her followers in America? He couldn't remember, but he knew the Temple had murdered people. Or was it each other? A film star? No, that was Manson's family. Same era because the Temple was a hippy death cult in the sixties. Or was it the seventies? 'The cult,' he said and tried not to look clueless. Too late, his eyes had gone vague and he'd frowned with confusion throughout his hazy recall. Max seemed pleased with his ignorance. It would enable him to expound. 'An organization that began right here in London, in 1967.' 'London?' 'Yes. In this city. Few are aware of that. But Sister Katherine was British. Her real name was Hermione Tirrill. She was born in Kent. Came from the remnants of a wealthy family. Her mother even had a title. She was a Baroness, and made sure little Katherine knew she was better than everyone. As did the boarding schools where she was educated until she was fourteen, when her father left his bankrupt family. And little Kathy and her mother were forced into the ignominy of poverty. She came down hard from a pile in the country to a council flat in Margate. Had to slum it in a second-hand school uniform. Down there with the rest of them. Must have been devastating for her, this plump little overachiever with funny teeth, while she watched her former peers become debutantes.' Kyle shrugged. 'I don't know much--' 'She was a runaway at fifteen and never spoke to her mother again. There was some time in borstal for theft and assault, then prison in her twenties. She was arrested for solicitation, and then again for running a brothel. Embezzlement, forgery too. A petty criminal. We can read what we choose into this. But what we do know from the few that have ever gone on record about her formative years, is that Katherine never liked a level playing field. That's for sure. But she liked power. And status. Wanted back what had been taken from her.' Kyle intuited a taint of bitterness in Max, but something else too: a grudging respect. 'But the Temple's origins are fascinating. It grew out of a cocktail of Scientology and apocalyptic millennial ideas, a mimicry of Christian sainthood, occult magic, Buddhism, abelief in reincarnation ... and various other things.' Max seemed to detach himself from Kyle then, and from the conversation and even the room, like an old man reminiscing fondly. 'It could have been so beautiful. Simple psych-therapy techniques, blended with medieval ideas of asceticism and piety. A life free of ego. These were the original values. All cloaked in mysticism for an aesthetic appeal.' Breaking his reverie and now self-conscious about his digression, Max killed the half-smile. 'A well-intentioned concept quickly usurped by a female sociopath and criminal elements. In London it was known as The Last Gathering. It became The Temple of the Last Days in France, during a schism in 1969. At a farm in Normandy where they nearly starved to death. The remnants migrated to America, under the same management. Where <i>they</i> self-destructed in Arizona. 1975. That you will surely be familiar with?' Kyle swallowed. 'I'm not that <i>familiar</i> with it.' He cleared his throat too aggressively. 'With them.' 'So I see.' Max said with a condescending inflection on the last two words. Momentarily, Kyle felt dizzy with embarrassment, as if he were being asked a question at school that he had no answer for. An illogical reaction, because why would he know anything about them? Had he pretended to? They were hardly important. And Max Solomon had invited him by email to the production offices in Bloomsbury, for a meeting about a 'prospective collaboration' without stating anything specific about the proposal. He felt his face go hot. 'No disrespect intended, but why would I be?' 'From what I have enjoyed about your work, Kyle, I'd say you might want to be.' Max smiled. And commenced issuingthe impression that he would ever be the unruffled and idly comfortable man, his success innate, entitled to prosperity and that all should know it. Signs recognizable to Kyle. And he instinctively disliked those who exhibited them. A class unto themselves; the money man, the film executive from the upper corporate tier, the self-important producer. Loved being close to the creative flame, stressed their own 'creativity' at every opportunity, and by doing so devalued the very word to house dust. But their aspiration to take ownership of another's work, he'd learned the hard way, was always reinforced by an underhand cleverness that you underestimated at your peril in this racket. <i>They</i> were the reason he had reduced himself to self-financed film-making, and a personal debt so colossal just thinking about it made it hard to breathe. Earlier, he'd been collected from an impressive reception so brightly lit he'd spent the entire wait squinting. When shown into the CEO's office and Max had risen to greet him, his movements so light and graceful, the tiny man had reminded Kyle, uncomfortably and unkindly, of a small clever monkey with quick glittering eyes. A primate rising to its hind legs, dressed in Paul Smith. The man was also tanned the colour of a sweet potato and his entire scalp was covered in a semi-transparent pelt of hair implants. He never understood why balding men paid so dearly for a procedure that only gave them thinning hair. The one time he'd been to Cannes, and the two visits he'd made to LA to talk to film agents, he'd found alien worlds full of men just like Max Solomon. When the email arrived the night before to request the meeting, Kyle had broken an anxious evening of reading jobads online and immediately checked out the Revelation Productions website. Instantly, his heart and its vain hope that the meeting might lead to an opportunity to work again, and that he would earn enough money to stave off his impending insolvency, cooled with dismay. His disappointment grew incrementally the more he saw of the website, until it was total. Revelation had published a book called <i>The Message</i>, which had sold 'Fifty Million Copies!' A strapline that filled most of the company's homepage. He'd seen the book around. It had changed the life of many female celebrities as well as being one of those books that every other woman had been reading on the London Underground for one summer. How long ago that summer was escaped him, but he'd never seen the book being read in public since. As well as <i>The Message</i>, the company produced a massive backlist of books, DVDs, CDs and merchandise that had a contemporary, life-affirming, self-help USP attached. The company claimed their products were 'groundbreaking' and 'definitive' and 'revelatory'. But the brand struck Kyle as being very Californian, a bit vulgar, and dated lo-tech, magic-bullet-chicanery, while also fortifying his aversion to bad science blended with spiritual horseshit. But it had come to this; with the exception of porn, he'd dropped to the bottom of the film industry. His documentary about the American Metal Core scene, <i>Shredding</i>, had been shown dozens of times on cable television, been a hit at festivals in 2006, and was still referred to as a cult classic in the music press; his film about witchcraft at a Scottish University, <i>Coven</i>, had got him into trouble for defamation, but it was also a film once shown on BBC2to considerable acclaim; thirty thousand people had bought the DVD of his film about the European Black Metal scene, <i>Reigning in Hell</i>; and two hundred thousand people had downloaded his documentary, <i>Blood Frenzy</i>, about three missing British hikers who vanished in the Arctic Circle: all of this success was real. Not bullshit. He'd walked the walk. He had a real and enviable filmography. But the distributors for the first three films claimed he owed them money: fifteen grand. And he still carried another ten grand's worth of production debt from <i>Coven</i> like an anvil upon his increasingly rounded shoulders. In total, his last self-financed film and unpaid rent had left him thirty thousand pounds in debt on a variety of credit cards and loans. A day of fiscal reckoning was nigh. Its anticipation made him incapable of a single undisturbed moment of happiness. It had also stolen his ability to relax, which seemed more hideous than losing the ephemera of joy. Something, he noted, guaranteed by the likes of Revelation Productions. Happiness: they promised that in spades. So maybe he should hold out for a DVD on tantric sex. 'What makes you think I'd be interested in a cult?' 'I've seen your work. It has a refreshing openness. When dealing with the niche, the derided, the forgotten. And the unexplained. You're not an exploiter, Kyle. I like that. Or a sensationalist. You have an open mind, my friend. So I began to wonder if we could work together. I have become very curious about your approach. Your vision.' Kyle resisted any show of being flattered, though he was. 'I make films with one agenda. To capture a subculture and to understand it. Or to tell a story honestly. As those who speak to me perceived the experience. I've only made filmsabout things that interest me. Stories that fascinate me, that either no one has told or told well enough. Stuff the mainstream media avoids or just misunderstands. And I won't compromise what I think is the right approach to achieving this. If I can bypass the current Hollywood and film industry business model in the process, it's a massive bonus. Artistic compromise, idea theft, getting turned over by suits. Enough already. I'm done with all that.' He said this as a veiled warning. He'd been told it was unwise to show his bitterness in meetings with producers, that it was unprofessional. These days, he chose to ignore advice like that. Max raised his trimmed eyebrows as high as he could, but the lower half of his face didn't budge. He'd had a facelift as well. The half-smile was starting to convince him it was, in fact, mocking. Kyle tried to smother his rising irritation. But it was like trying to get the wrong size lid on a tin of red paint. His voice came out all tight. 'And my time is coming. For film-makers like me.' He felt silly for saying it, but was also revelling in how the film industry quaked at what digital technology was doing to their age-old monopoly. The least he could do was remind its representatives of this fact. 'Eventually I intend to be the media provider of my own work. For a specific audience. And it will never be any dumbed-down, censored crap put out by executive know-nothings, with their profit and loss sheets, their bottom lines, and their careers. I already finance, shoot and edit the films myself. Owning distribution is the next battle. That's where I stand.' 'I see.' Max looked at his tiny feminine fingers, spread them on his desk, studied his nails for a few seconds, whileeither frowning or fighting the half-smile; it was hard to tell with someone whose chin was probably once part of their forehead. 'Your film <i>Blood Frenzy</i> struck me as unequivocal in its acceptance of, shall we say, a paranormal aspect to that tragic story. What I took from the film was a strong suggestion that something very old, something that defied natural law, had been responsible for the disappearance of a significant number of people ... in a distant part of the world. Did you come to believe that?' <i>Here we go</i>. 'We all want the truth, Max. I just tried to understand what happened. There's no way I will ever know what really happened up there. I don't think anyone ever will. But I got an authentic sense of the place the story came out of. People suggested things, without much prompting. I never tried to steer the interviews, or to emboss a theory on anything. My mind and my lens were wide open. The viewer is the interpreter. These days everyone wants a say. The world is a hanging jury. I give the audience the known facts and the fallible testimony of the interviewees. And to be honest, I had no idea what that film was going to suggest to me as I made it.' 'I see. Interesting.' <i>But did he see?</i> While Kyle spoke, Max had been frowning as if he was not listening, but thinking instead of what he was going to say next. It annoyed him even more, if that were possible. 'I don't like polemic, Mr Solomon. Most audiences don't either. My trick is to choose a story that is so interesting, the audience has to get involved on some level. It's the most I can do as a director. I don't use stars or shoot well-known events, which is why I've given up on the <i>system</i>.' That wordalmost came out of his mouth on fire. He took a deep breath. 'So I find stories for the neglected mass of non-mainstream viewers. And there's an awful lot of us. I'm totally pull-based from word of mouth online. That's my constituency.' 'You make a living from this couture approach?' Kyle paused for longer than he wished. 'Not yet. I was ripped off on the music films and <i>Coven</i>. So I made <i>Blood Frenzy</i> a non-product. I gave it away free from my website. Some indie record labels embedded ads on the page which covered some of my costs. I'm in arrears on the rest. But it's never been about money.' He wondered whether he should just get up and leave. He couldn't even pretend he liked the man. And he'd be one of a dozen directors Max was currently feeling out for something tabloid. At least it wasn't over a lunch he was paying for; this was an actual production office. But he could already intui...</p><h2>The Last Enchantment (The Arthurian Saga, Book 3)</h2><p><p> Arthur Pendragon is King! Unchallenged on the battlefield, he melds the country together in a time of promise.

They are must reads for any romance reader, for any lover of Arthurian legend, for any history buff, for any voracious reader, and may be the books to get non-readers started. Basically, they should be read by everyone! Mary Stewart&#39;s research for these books is phenomenal. Her understanding of myth and its relationship to fact is remarkable. The books are complex, yet incredibly inviting and you will absolutely love the characters. They also weave together so beautifully that you won&#39;t be able to read only one. Two things I find particularly interesting in this series is the portrayal of Arthur and the fall of Camelot. Arthur represents all of humanity in these books as opposed to the more mythical figure you usually see. And the fall of Camelot is more internal rather than external--more about the passions and lusts in the heart rather than a more obvious loss of power. The books go in this order: The Crystal Cave, The Hollow Hills, The Last Enchantment, The Wicked Day.

Danzig Baldaev&#x2019;s unparallelled ethnographic achievement, documenting more than 3,000 tattoo drawings, was made during a lifetime working as a prison guard. His recording of this esoteric world was reported to the KGB, who unexpectedly supported him, realizing the importance of being able to establish facts about convicts by reading the images on their bodies. The motifs depicted represent the uncensored lives of the criminal classes, ranging from violence and pornography to politics and alcohol. A medieval knight is surrounded by the severed heads of his enemies, a naked woman simultaneously services a man and two dwarfs, a crying President Gorbachev grips a human bone between sabre-like fangs, a group of angels drink vodka with God on a cloud--the meanings of these arresting images are explained to the uninitiated eye. Sergei Vasiliev&#x2019;s graphic photographs show the grim reality of the Russian prison system and some of the alarming characters that inhabit it, while the illustrated criminals of Russia tell the tale of their closed society.

Gough aims both high and low. On the one hand, he shows how the peaceable responses of Bear, equanimity unshaken despite discovering that her food stores have disappeared, to Rabbit's rude comments and behavior gradually work a profound change in his character&#x2014;and on the other, in the course of their exchanges, he has the long-eared lagomorph deliver a clinically explicit, hilariously extended disquisition on why his kind eats its own poo. Bear goes even further, saving Rabbit from an attacking wolf and then, when he shamefacedly produces the food that he had (yes) stolen earlier, inviting him to join her for a moonlit picnic and a snuggle in her cozy den. The narrative, laid out in short, well-leaded lines, likewise snuggles on every page with Field's duotone cartoon scenes of the two furry figures meeting, parting, starting separate snowmen but ultimately coming together to finish one, and finally sharing a honeycomb and other goodies before bedding down in the warm den. When, showing a newly awakened sense of compassion, Rabbit wonders if the snowman is lonely, Bear has the perfect solution: "In the morning," she murmurs drowsily, "we can make him a friend." Young readers will come away with fresh insights into both poo and peacemaking.

Despite that dismal introduction, Smith developed a fascination with okra, and as he researched the plant and began to experiment with it in his own kitchen, he discovered an amazing range of delicious ways to cook and eat it, along with ingenious and surprising ways to process the plant from tip-to-tail: pods, leaves, flowers, seeds, and stalks. Smith talked okra with chefs, food historians, university researchers, farmers, homesteaders, and gardeners. The summation of his experimentation and research comes together in <em>The Whole Okra</em>, a lighthearted but information-rich collection of okra history, lore, recipes, craft projects, growing advice, and more.</p> <p><em>The Whole Okra</em> includes classic recipes such as fried okra pods as well as unexpected delights including okra seed pancakes and okra flower vodka.

He gives directions for saving seed for replanting, for a breeding project, or for a stockpile of seed for making okra oil, okra flour, okra tempeh, and more. Smith has grown over 75 varieties of okra, and he describes the nuanced differences in flavor, texture, and color; the best-tasting varieties; and his personal favorites. Smith&#x2019;s wry humor and seed-to-stem enthusiasm for his subject infuse every chapter with just the right mix of fabulous recipes and culinary tips, unique projects, and fun facts about this vagabond vegetable with enormous potential.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Expert okra enthusiast Chris Smith writes regularly for <em>The Heirloom Gardener</em>, the <em>Mother Earth News</em> blog, and the <em>Farmers&#x2019; Almanac</em> blog.

Hellmuth teaches exactly which hands to play, when to bluff, when to raise, and when to fold. In addition Hellmuth provides techniques for reading other players and staying cool under pressure. There are also special chapters on how to beat online poker games and an inside look at tournament play.</p></p><p><p>Phil Hellmuth, Jr. is a ten-time World Series of Poker Champion and all-time leading money winner at the World Series of Poker. In addition to appearances on the Discovery Channel, E!, ESPN, and Fox Sports Net, he has been featured in <em>Sports Illustrated</em>, <em>Time</em>, and <em>Esquire</em>. Phil also contributes to <em>Gambling Times Magazine</em> and writes for many poker websites. He lives with his family in Palo Alto, California.</p>Champion Phil Hellmuth gets listeners into the nitty-gritty of hands played and bets wagered. Helmuth labels players as animals--from mouse (conservative) to jackal (aggressive). The popular Texas Hold 'Em is one of several games discussed. If you've never played poker, the presentation can be overwhelming, with many cards to recall from examples. Further, Helmuth begins each section with the words "Let's talk about ...," which becomes repetitive. A glossary of hands would be more useful. And more discussion is needed on spotting body language for the purpose of reading other players. Nonetheless, if you've played a few home games, deal yourself in and learn from Helmuth, a master of the well-timed wager.

The trick is to cook it in a water bath to ensure gentle heat surrounds the custard so it won&#x2019;t break or curdle. There are various methods of infusing coconut flavor into a flan, but coconut milk is the easiest, giving you intense flavor and also a smooth texture. When I first made this recipe, I thought adding shredded coconut to custard would give even more flavor. It does, but it takes away from the velvety texture, so I opt to sprinkle some toasted coconut on the top instead.</p> <p>1 Preheat the oven to 350�F. Spray a Bundt pan with cooking spray and drizzle the cajeta into the pan, turning to coat the bottom and sides.</p> <p>2 Using an electric mixer, beat the condensed milk, coconut milk, evaporated milk, eggs, vanilla, and salt. Pour the mixture over the cajeta into the Bundt pan. Put the pan inside a roasting pan and fill the roasting pan with warm water to come halfway up the sides of the Bundt pan. Cover the Bundt pan with foil.</p> <p>3 Bake until the center jiggles slightly when the pan is moved, about 1 hour 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 30 minutes, then transfer to the refrigerator and chill for 3 hours or overnight.</p> <p>4 Turn the flan out onto a platter. Sprinkle with toasted coconut and serve.</p> <p></p>MARCELA VALLADOLID is the host of <i>Mexican Made Easy</i> on Food Network.

Previously he taught at Wheaton College and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. He is the author of numerous articles and several books. Erik lives with his wife, Donna, and their four children.</p><p>&#x201c;Dr. Thoennes is a masterful teacher. With biblical precision and profound understanding, he comes to grips with the most often asked questions about the gospel. The beauty of following Christ comes through with such clarity that the reader will want to fall in love with Jesus all over again.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Robert E. Coleman</strong><strong>,</strong> Distinguished Senior Professor of Evangelism and Discipleship, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary <em><br></em></p><p>&#x201c;Helpful, concise, accessible: this book will provide clarity and conviction for those looking for answers to the big questions.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Josh Moody</strong><strong>,</strong> Senior Pastor, College Church, Wheaton, Illinois; author, <em>Journey to Joy: The Psalms of Ascent&nbsp;</em></p><p>&#x201c;In clear, insightful and relevant ways Thoennes tackles some of life&#x2019;s most bewildering questions. His treatment of the perennial dilemmas that have plagued inquisitive minds avoids easy clich�s and unrealistic answers. Thoennes artfully and biblically turns the question marks of sincere seekers into exclamation points that undergird life with confidence and certainty. This book is a one of a kind resource among similar books that are either too light and unrealistic or too heavy to get our heads around. As such, it is a welcome arrival and an important read&#x2015;the kind of book that you are happy to share with a friend!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Joseph M. Stowell</strong><strong>,</strong> President, Cornerstone University, Grand Rapids, Michigan </p><p>&#x201c;Socrates&#x2019; well-known statement, &#x2018;The unexamined life is not worth living,&#x2019; is an entirely appropriate start to <em>Life's Biggest Questions</em>. Stepping outside of one&#x2019;s day-to-day existence to reflect on the big-picture questions is understandable and commendable. This book clearly, concisely, and thoughtfully presents answers from an evangelical Christian perspective. Thoennes is not only able to articulate Christian theology and history, but also help readers think through the implications for their own lives.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Heather Campbell</strong>, Vice President, Atheist Coalition of San Diego</p><p>&#x201c;A concise and engaging introduction to the core beliefs of the Christian faith that would be helpful both to followers of Christ and those who are investigating the Christian faith and want to understand what Christians believe. Not only does Thoennes show how these beliefs are rooted in Scripture but he also helps us see how they practically relate to the Christian life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Keith Johnson</strong>, Director, Theological Education and Development, Campus Crusade for Christ</p><p>&#x201c;A thorough and accessible introduction to what Christians believe and why we believe it. Thoennes encourages believers and non-believers alike to examine their assumptions in light of biblical truth and to consider the life-altering implications of their beliefs. <em>Life&#x2019;s Biggest Questions</em> is an encouraging, pastoral introduction to Christianity. Thoennes makes the case that all Christians&#x2015;from the seminary student to the homemaker&#x2015;will benefit from the study of theology, and that our lives are profoundly affected by a true knowledge of God. Reading this book has been an encouragement to my faith&#x2015;bolstering and clarifying my understanding of truth and deepening my appreciation of God and his beautiful work of redemption. The discussion questions at the end of each chapter illustrate the practical significance of theology and will lead readers to fruitful examination of their beliefs and helpful applications of doctrinal truths. Small groups, churches, and individuals will benefit from Thoennes&#x2019; pastoral invitation to engage with the most important questions in life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Laura Rosenkranz</strong>, homemaker; educator</p><p>&#x201c;It is refreshing to see a book that addresses our deepest concerns from a distinctively theological perspective. Professor Thoennes is a master communicator, and <em>Life's Biggest Questions</em> is marked by an accessible, interesting style. The book is filled with content and distinctively characterized by repeated examples of practical application. It is a fun read and would make an excellent text for a course in theology or Christian worldview.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>J. P. Moreland</strong><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Biola University; author,&nbsp;<em>The Soul: How We Know It&#x2019;s Real and Why It Matters</em></p><p>&#x201c;This splendid book provides clear and concise answers to life&#x2019;s greatest questions. It is a perfect volume for intelligent truth seekers and Christians who want to build a firmer biblical foundation for their faith.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Lyle W. Dorsett</strong><strong>,</strong> Billy Graham Professor of Evangelism, Beeson Divinity School, Samford University</p><p>&#x201c;People without questions may have deluded themselves into thinking they have all the answers. Being finite and fallen should awaken curiosity in the heart of any honest person. Thoennes does more than encourage the asking of questions. He directs readers to the Scriptures as a source of answers both wise and good. Furthermore, he cultivates curiosities to morph into questions that ripen into the rich fruit of wonder, awe, and eventually worship. I know this, because he is my friend. My life has been encouraged by his personal counsel as well as by this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Jerry Root</strong>, Associate Professor of Evangelism and Leadership, Wheaton College; coauthor, <em>The Sacrament of Evangelism</em>; Associate Director, Institute for Strategic Evangelism, Wheaton College</p><p>&#x201c;This is an easy read about profound truths. Thoennes&#x2019; book is bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside. He writes with elegant simplicity about biblical doctrine, with clear conceptualization and user-friendly prose concerning the basic doctrines of the Scriptures. Thoennes&#x2019; trustworthy, sturdy, and receptor-oriented writing puts the nourishment of the Word within the reader&#x2019;s reach. It is a joy to think after him. Since our spirituality and relationship with God flows directly from our theology and our beliefs about God, Thoennes&#x2019; work will be of interest to anyone looking for a basic biblical foundation for soulcare and spiritual formation work.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Betsy A. Barber</strong>, Director, Center for Spiritual Renewal, Biola University; Associate Director, Institute for Spiritual Formation, Talbot School of Theology</p><p>&#x201c;I can't think of anybody better suited to explain the mysteries of the universe than Erik Thoennes. Life's Biggest Questions is a compelling read.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Mark Joseph</strong>, author, <em>Faith, God &amp; Rock 'n' Roll</em>; Columnist, <em>The Huffington Post</em></p></p><h2>The Forgotten Beasts of Eld</h2><p><b>World Fantasy Award-Winner<br>Newly available in print and e-book editions</b><br><br>"Rich and regal."<br>&#x2015;<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>Young Sybel, the heiress of powerful wizards, needs the company of no-one outside her gates.

The end result is that the disciple becomes the kind of person who naturally does what Jesus did.</p><p>How the church understands salvation and the gospel is the key to recovering a biblical theology of discipleship. Our doctrines of grace and salvation, in some cases, actually prevent us from creating an expectation that we are to be disciples of Jesus. A person can profess to be a Christian and yet still live under the impression that they don&#x2019;t need to actually follow Jesus. Being a follower is seen as an optional add-on, not a requirement. It is a choice, not a demand. Being a Christian today has no connection with the biblical idea that we are formed into the image of Christ.</p><p>In this ground-breaking new book, pastor and author Bill Hull shows why our existing models of evangelism and discipleship fail to actually produce followers of Jesus. He looks at the importance of recovering a robust view of the gospel and taking seriously the connection between conversion&#x2014;answering the call to follow Jesus&#x2014;and discipleship&#x2014;living like the one we claim to follow.</p></p><p><p>Bill Hull is a discipleship evangelist and the author of the bestselling discipleship classics, <em>The Disciple-Making Pastor</em>, and <em>Jesus Christ, Disciplemaker</em>. He served as a pastor for 20 years and now leads the Bonhoeffer Project.&nbsp;Bill regularly speaks and teaches on discipleship and also serves as an adjunct professor at Talbot School of Theology, Biola University. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>I&#x2019;ve been reading and listening to Bill Hull for years. He&#x2019;s been a discipleship coach in my life, and for countless others. I&#x2019;m so thankful for him, his work, and his passion for discipleship. -- Ed Stetzer, www.edstetzer.com<br><br>Bill Hull is spot on. Disciples are not a special class of Christians. Bill has provided us with a challenging and thought-provoking examination of biblical conversion and discipleship. My bet is that you won&#x2019;t agree with everything in these pages. (I didn&#x2019;t.) But I guarantee you that your ministry and personal walk with Jesus will benefit greatly from wrestling with the wisdom and insights he provides. -- Larry Osborne, author and pastor, North Coast Church, Vista, CA<br><br>Bill Hull believes that in receiving Christ as Lord and Savior, we also receive his lifestyle of making disciples. The two commitments go together. Not the kind of book to read lounging in a rocking chair munching on chocolates. -- Robert E. Coleman, author, The Master Plan for Evangelism<br><br>I am convinced that one of the deepest flaws in discipleship derives from our lack of understanding of the significance of repentance as an intrinsic part of a living relationship with God. Bill, as the longtime activist for the disciple-making cause, makes an irrefutable case for the relationship of ongoing conversion to a life of discipleship. A well-written book on an important topic. -- Alan Hirsch, award-winning author; founder, Forge, 100Movements, and Future Travelers; www.alanhirsch.org<br><br>Bill Hull has been committed to discipleship for many years and has helped to shape many of the minds who consider discipleship the core mission of the church. I admire Bill so much because he is not just a theorist but a practitioner who does what he says others ought to do. He has given those committed to discipleship a new theological tool to promote something that has been left out of the church for some time. I know you will enjoy this book as much as I did. -- Jim Putman, senior pastor, Real Life Ministries; coauthor, Discipleshift<br><br>Bill Hull&#x2019;s lifelong journey has given him one of the most important leadership roles in the discipleship movement of the last fifty years, and makes him uniquely qualified to guide the church to true biblical discipleship. This will be a hard read for some because Bill speaks directly and with no nonsense to those who have substituted elitist programs for biblical discipleship. Read, and heed, the clarion call of this book. -- Michael J. Wilkins, Distinguished Professor of New Testament Language and Literature, Talbot School of Theology<br><br>Discipleship has turned into a buzzword that too many are throwing around without properly defining it. In such a sea of voices, we desperately need a navigational chart to get us back on a biblical course. In this book, Bill Hull provides the course correction we need. -- Robby Gallaty, senior pastor, Long Hollow Baptist Church<br><br>This book is a must for church leaders. It deals with the root issues, the upstream theological realities that are required to make a sustainable discipleship movement in your church and beyond. Read it, ponder it, and let it change your life and ministry. I heartily endorse Conversion and Discipleship. -- Dr. Bobby Harrington, director, Discipleship.org; board member Relational Discipleship Network; author and pastor<br><br>Bill Hull writes boldly about how Dallas Willard challenged him to think differently about one of the key pillars of evangelicalism, the meaning of the gospel, and the natural bond between conversation and discipleship (aka apprenticeship). For Jesus&#x2019; disciples, the good news was not that they could say a magic phrase and then go to heaven when they died; the good news was that they could enter into an apprenticeship with Jesus and begin living an eternal sort of life right then and there. Nothing has changed. That is still the good news. -- Gary W.

It&#x2019;s not like in your sophomore year of high school beside your yearbook photo you wrote, &#x201c;I hope to grow cynical and distrustful of humanity by the time I hit forty. I&#x2019;m also hoping my cynicism will damage my family and make me impossible to work with. Go Ravens!&#x201d;</p><p>Had you written that in high school, somebody would have insisted you go to counseling...immediately. But that wasn&#x2019;t your headspace. You were optimistic, even hopeful. And by the time you hit your early twenties and shed the yoke of your parents, you were downright idealistic. You knew how to make the world a better place, and you were intent on doing it.</p><p>That&#x2019;s my story too. As a young law student working in downtown Toronto, I oozed optimism about setting the world right. I wanted to practice constitutional law and argue my first case before the Supreme Court of Canada prior to my thirtieth birthday. I even discovered that someone with a positive attitude and a healthy work ethic could make a difference in a downtown firm. I was a newlywed, and halfway through my first year at the law firm, I became a new dad. I wanted to be successful yet not work the slavishly long hours young lawyers were famous for, working every night and most weekends. Some firms in the downtown core even had cots in the office and hired in-house chefs so their employees didn&#x2019;t have to go home or leave the office. I didn&#x2019;t want that to be me.</p><p>So I hustled hard. I arrived at the office at seven o&#x2019;clock, worked through lunch, and by five o&#x2019;clock managed to sneak out of the office when no one was looking so I could get home to my wife, Toni, and our newborn son. Throughout the day, I focused on being massively productive and getting outcomes our clients (and my bosses) would love.</p><p>Strangely enough, I managed to succeed. My idealism smashed through some barriers quickly. Not only did I avoid working the impossible hours lawyers typically put in, but I also actually earned the firm money&#x2014;something students weren&#x2019;t expected to do. The partners even offered me a job after my year of apprenticeship was over.</p><p>But I found my idealism as a budding lawyer challenged by something I noticed all around me: I was surrounded by lawyers who weren&#x2019;t happy. In fact, many who hadn&#x2019;t even hit age forty had become downright miserable. I remember one particular Friday when a lawyer in his thirties came into the firm waving a lottery ticket. &#x201c;See this ticket?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If I win this thing, you&#x2019;ll never see my face again.&#x201d;</p><p>The strange part is that he owned the firm (and made a big income every year, may I add). It&#x2019;s never a good sign when the owner of a thriving firm buys a lottery ticket, hoping to cash out and leave it all behind.</p><p>I used to tell my fellow law school graduates, &#x201c;If you can find a happy lawyer in this city, I&#x2019;ll pay you a million dollars.&#x201d; I knew it was a safe bet since none of us could find a happy lawyer.<br><br></p><p><i>A Gnawing Negativity</i></p><p>How do people who seemingly have everything end up jaded and disillusioned so quickly? The juxtaposition of sleek office towers, luxury cars, tailored suits, and expensive lunches coupled with chronic dissatisfaction still surprises me. But it shouldn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Jesus told us it was very possible, even probable, that we could gain the world and lose our soul. I get that. But in the trenches of success, I saw more than a happiness deficit in the people around me. I saw a much deeper and more pervasive condition: cynicism. I often wondered, How do you go from idealistic to cynical in just a few short years?</p><p>It&#x2019;s a troubling question, and over the years I&#x2019;ve asked it again and again. Chances are you&#x2019;ve seen it happen around you too...</p><p>~&nbsp; Your friend who has had her heart broken many times now thinks no man can be trusted.</p><p>~&nbsp; Your optimistic college roommate who went into investment banking is convinced all his colleagues are simply in it for themselves, which is exactly why he is now too.</p><p>~&nbsp; Your brother-in-law cop has seen too much too many times to believe the best about anybody anymore.</p><p>~&nbsp; Even your teammate at work shoots down every idea you bring to the table, instantly listing the many reasons your strategy is doomed to fail.</p><p>The people around you can be depressing. But almost as disturbing as what we see around us is what we feel within us. Cynicism isn&#x2019;t just something other people experience; it&#x2019;s something you sense growing within you. While the time line may vary given your life experience, here&#x2019;s what many people discover: the optimism of your teens and twenties gives way to the realism of your thirties. By the time you hit thirty, many of your once-in-love friends have split up, many of your once-enthusiastic coworkers hate their jobs, and many once-solid friendships have dissolved.</p><p>So where does the realism of your thirties lead? That depends. Unchecked, it could lead you into the sinkhole of cynicism.<br><br></p><p><i>Sinkhole Ahead</i></p><p>I remember the first time I saw cynicism begin to grow within me. I was in my early thirties. Paradoxically, it was in pastoral ministry and not the practice of law that I felt cynicism begin to take root in my heart. Halfway through law school, I sensed God calling me into full-time ministry of some kind. I had grown up in a Christian home, and after drifting in my late teen years, I recommitted my life to Christ in my early twenties. Despite my renewed Christianity, though, law was my main focus. I never imagined leaving law to pursue preaching or congregational ministry. But that&#x2019;s the amazing thing about feeling called to something: we&#x2019;re taken in a new direction on an unexpected adventure.</p><p>After sensing God calling me into ministry, I took a few years to figure out exactly what that meant. In the meantime, I finished law school and completed the grueling bar admissions course. After passing the bar exam and earning my license to practice law, I shocked everyone (including myself) by heading off to seminary, purely out of obedience.</p><p>Confused about what to do next, I decided to dip my toe into congregational ministry for the first time when I was halfway through seminary. I moved with my wife and young son an hour north of Toronto to a rural community, Oro-Medonte, to begin ministry in the community in which I still live today. My assignment was to serve three small churches that hadn&#x2019;t hired a full-time pastor or grown at all in more than forty years. They called me their &#x201c;student pastor.&#x201d; That didn&#x2019;t mean I served students; it meant I served the churches as the senior pastor while still a student. It also meant the pay was half what they would pay a &#x201c;real&#x201d; minister. But it sounded like a call to me.</p><p>The churches were tiny. One had an average attendance of six on Sunday mornings. That included slow-moving vehicles and low-flying aircraft. When my wife, son, and I arrived, we grew the church by 50 percent overnight. It was sensational. The second of the three churches had fourteen people in church most Sundays. And the &#x201c;megachurch&#x201d; among the three congregations had an average attendance of twenty-three.</p><p>Naturally, when you&#x2019;re in congregations that small, ministry is inherently relational. You visit people and invest in them, all the while trying to unite them around a bigger vision and better strategy that will move the mission forward. Even as our churches grew into the hundreds, I did my best to stay relationally connected. In the first decade of ministry, I was in people&#x2019;s homes almost every day. It was tremendously exciting as more and more new people began to show up. I still remember the first time a couple I&#x2019;ll call Roger and Mary walked in the door one Sunday morning.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t take long to figure out that Roger and Mary had very real needs. They didn&#x2019;t have much money. Their subcompact car constantly broke down. They seemed to go from crisis to crisis in every area of their lives: financial, relational, emotional, and spiritual.</p><p>Despite being busy now leading hundreds of people, I decided I would help in every way I could. Even though the church they attended had a small budget, we managed to buy Roger and Mary groceries and gift cards. We gave them gas money and made sure their car stayed on the road. I went to their apartment in the south end of town (a twenty-minute drive each way) to regularly pray with them, encourage them, and help them as much as I could.</p><p>Roger and Mary kept asking for more assistance. Their phone calls became more frequent, and I often headed over in the evenings to help them navigate whatever crisis they were facing. I poured my heart and soul into praying for their family and trying to assist them in any way possible. It&#x2019;s not an exaggeration to say I spent more time with their family than I spent with any other family in my first ten years of leadership.</p><p>Meanwhile, the little churches grew quickly. More and more people began showing up, and that meant I couldn&#x2019;t visit people as often as I had previously. There were just too many people. Even as the churches grew, Roger and Mary demanded my personal attention. They were poor, and I knew of God&#x2019;s particular emphasis on caring for the poor. In the midst of it all, I noticed a growing ingratitude and increasing neediness from this couple. At times, helping them felt like trying to empty the ocean with a spoon, but I was determined to serve and demonstrate God&#x2019;s grace.</p><p>Before long, Roger and Mary started to bring their two-year-old niece to church with them. She was a great kid, but discipline wasn&#x2019;t a strong skill in the family. Their niece spent time one Sunday running up and down the aisles during church, angering some older members.</p><p>The issue came up at one of our elder board meetings. Some members insisted we had to do something about this child who was disrupting the service. I stood up for Roger and Mary&#x2019;s family, telling the board I&#x2019;d rather have a church full of unruly kids than a church full of well-behaved senior citizens. Fortunately for everyone, that settled the matter. And I told Roger and Mary that it wouldn&#x2019;t be a problem anymore.</p><p>Even with that controversy put to rest, this couple seemed to become less and less comfortable as the church continued to grow. Finally one Sunday morning, Roger grabbed his niece and ran out of the church, announcing, &#x201c;This place isn&#x2019;t for us anymore. You don&#x2019;t care about us! We&#x2019;re leaving!&#x201d;</p><p>I was stunned. Naturally, I followed up with him and asked what on earth had happened.</p><p>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t done enough for us,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>I had no idea what to say. Seriously? We haven&#x2019;t done enough? Are you kidding me?</p><p>His comments cut directly and deeply into my small but growing pastoral heart.</p><p>&#x201c;Roger,&#x201d; I mustered, &#x201c;that breaks my heart. It&#x2019;s not an exaggeration to say that in my time in leadership, I have never spent more one-on-one time with anyone than you and your family. And it&#x2019;s not just me. This community has sacrificed to be here for you again and again.&#x201d;</p><p>My words made zero difference. He kept insisting our efforts weren&#x2019;t enough and that we didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;that I didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;really care about them. He said our church had let him down, that we&#x2019;d abandoned his family at their lowest point.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t know how to make the situation better. They didn&#x2019;t want to make it better. Then they left the church for good.<br><br></p><p><i>The Slide into Cynicism Begins</i></p><p>I was shocked. And angry. And heartbroken. I honestly didn&#x2019;t have a category for what happened.</p><p>It was in that moment that I felt cynicism welling up inside me. It&#x2019;s like a voice inside me was saying, <i>Useless</i>. <i>Everything you invested was a total waste of time and energy. And you know what? If he did that to you, others will too. So don&#x2019;t care like you used to. Don&#x2019;t invest in people like you used to. Don&#x2019;t give of yourself like you used to. People will just use you and reject you in the end anyway. There&#x2019;s no point.</i></p><p>At the time, I hadn&#x2019;t even heard of writers like John Townsend or Henry Cloud, who have helped scores of people understand what boundaries are. Nor was I good at spotting potential mental health issues. I genuinely tried to help, and in the end I got genuinely burned.</p><p>That&#x2019;s how cynicism starts.</p><p>Cynicism begins not because you don&#x2019;t care but because you do care.</p><p>It starts because you poured your heart into something and got little in return. Or maybe you got something in return, but it was the opposite of what you desired. You fell in love, only to have that relationship dissolve. You threw your heart into your job, only to be told you were being let go. You were completely there for your mom, only to have her tell you you&#x2019;re such a disappointment.</p><p>And you can&#x2019;t help but think to yourself, <i>What gives?</i></p><p>Most cynics are former optimists. You&#x2019;d never know it now, but there was a time when they were hopeful, enthusiastic, and even cheerful. There&#x2019;s something inside the human spirit that wants to hope, wants to think things will get better. Nearly everyone starts life with a positive outlook.</p><p>So what happens? How do you go from being so positive to so negative? At least three things happen to the human heart as it grows cynical.</p><p><b>1. You Know Too Much</b></p><p>You would think knowledge is always a good thing. But strangely, knowledge will often sadden you. Solomon, whom we&#x2019;ll meet again later, was world renowned for his wisdom. He put it this way: &#x201c;The greater my wisdom, the greater my grief. To increase knowledge only increases sorrow.&#x201d; Not exactly the most inspirational thing you&#x2019;ve ever read. It&#x2019;s like Eeyore wrote that part of the Bible. While that verse may make for a terrible social media post, the insight itself is quite helpful.</p><p>In some ways, ignorance is bliss. Had I never known that some people, like Roger and Mary, would end up being disappointed even after a massive investment by a community of people, it would have been easy&#x2014;even automatic&#x2014;to keep investing in people. But having been burned, I found that over the months and years that followed, I began to view needy people more suspiciously. Would they treat me the same way?<br></p></p><h2>St. Gertrude the Great: Herald of Divine Love</h2><p>A brief life of this 12th century German Benedictine nun, the only female saint titled &#34;The Great.&#34; Discusses her method of prayer, some sample prayers, and covers some of her revelations.

But the giant horse is unapproachable, showing nothing but fear and fury towards people. When the stallion gets caught in quicksand, can Steve get close enough to save the wild horse?</p><p><b>Walter Farley</b>'s first book,&nbsp;<i>The Black Stallion</i>, was an instant hit when it appeared in 1941. Mr. Farley went on to write thirty-three other enormously popular books about the Black Stallion and other horses which were published in more than twenty countries. He died in 1989, shortly before the publication of his last novel,&nbsp;<i>The Young Black Stallion</i>, written with his son Steven.Azul Island. Latitude 14 degrees 3 North. Longitude 56 degrees 28 West.<br><br> The freighter Horn, nine days out of New York City, was a mile from Azul Island, and running parallel to it. The freighter's only passenger, Steve Duncan, stood beside the captain at the bow of the ship. Steve wore only a pair of swimming trunks, and his tanned, lithe body was wet with the spray that whipped from the prow of the Horn as she dipped to meet each oncoming wave. Steve had been waiting many hours for his first sight of Azul Island.<br><br> The captain passed his binoculars to Steve, saying, "We can't get any closer, Steve. Dangerous reefs there. I've never been this close before."<br><br> Through the glasses, Steve could see the long white line of churning waters foaming across the reef between the ship and the island. He watched the waters turn from white to blue-black once they had crossed the reef. Surging forward, the waves gathered momentum and height, only to disappear within the mist which hung like a gray veil about the base of Azul Island. Then there would be a sudden, bursting whiteness again, momentarily blotting out the gray, as the waves smashed heavily against what Steve knew must be a formidable wall of stone.<br><br> But above the mist he could see more of Azul Island, for the rock, a yellowish gold in color, rose a thousand or more feet above the sea. It was this massive rock that held his gaze as the Horn ran the length of the island. Azul Island was unlike any of the other islands they had passed in the Caribbean Sea. Not only did it differ in color from the green mountain ranges Steve had seen, but there were no peaks or ravines or indentations of any kind over its smooth, bare surface. The top of Azul Island seemed to be rounded off at one height, and Steve could only think of it as a huge stone that had been dropped into the sea. It was cold and barren, as though vegetation would have none of it.<br><br> The captain said, "Azul means blue in Spanish. I don't see where it gets its name. There's nothing but yellow rock."<br><br> "There's supposed to be a plain at one end of the island," Steve said.<br><br> "We're about opposite it now," the captain returned, "but the mist is blanketing it. That is, if you want to call it a plain. From the sea, it's always looked like a sandy spit. Oh, it's somewhat rolling and green in spots, but a sailor might as well be drowned in the sea as be shipwrecked on it. Azul Island is one of the most forlorn places I've ever seen." The captain paused and turned to the boy. "How did you know about the plain? That is, if you don't mind my asking, Steve. Your interest in Azul Island has aroused my curiosity. I was surprised that you even knew of it, because the only map you'll ever find it on is our large-scale navigation map of this area. And it's nowhere near any of the airline routes. I just can't figure out . . ."<br><br> The boy's eyes were still turned shoreward as he said, "A very good friend of mine, Phil Pitcher, now lives on Antago. He wrote me about Azul Island a few weeks ago."<br><br> "Phil Pitcher," the captain repeated thoughtfully. "I believe I remember him, Steve. Sort of a small, thin man, wearing steel-rimmed glasses?"<br><br> "That's Pitch, all right." Steve smiled. "I think he did get down to Antago on the Horn at that."<br><br> "He sure did," the captain said, laughing. "If you don't go to Antago on my ship, you don't go at all. We're the only line that puts in at Antago; it's too far off the shipping lanes for any of the larger lines to bother with. Sure, I remember your Phil Pitcher. He spent most of his time reading during the trip, but every once in a while he'd come out of his shell and tell me about himself. It seems he was a little worried about having given up a job he'd had practically all his life to go to Antago. He wasn't quite sure at the time that he'd done the right thing."<br><br> "He's sure now," Steve said quietly. "From what he says in his letters, he's happier than he ever was at home. He wasn't very happy at home. Pitch lived next door to us for as long as I can remember, and he was pretty much a part of our family. We all knew he hated his job. He was a bookkeeper in the office of a big lumberyard, and the job kept him inside all the time. He didn't like that. I guess everyone had heard Pitch say at one time or another that he was going to quit and go to Antago to live with his stepbrother, Tom, who has a sugar plantation there. But no one believed him. Then a little over a year ago he did it. Quit just as he'd said he would, and went to Antago."<br><br> "Good man," the captain said, smiling.</p><h2>The Big Book of Fenton Glass, 1940-1970 (Schiffer Book for Collectors)</h2><p>This popular tour of sumptuous glass colors, decorative treatments, and forms (from baskets and bowls to sandwich trays and vases) produced by the famous Fenton Art Glass Company is back in a new edition, complete with new values for collectors.

It was not just because the posters with a picture of him that were passed around Downworld in Peru were so wildly unflattering. It was because Peru was one of his favorite places. He had had many adventures there, and had many wonderful memories, starting with the time in 1791 when he had invited Ragnor Fell to join him for a festive sightseeing escape in Lima.<br> <br>1791<br> <br>Magnus awoke in his roadside inn just outside Lima, and once he had arrayed himself in an embroidered waistcoat, breeches, and shining buckled shoes, he went in search of breakfast. Instead he found his hostess, a plump woman whose long hair was covered with a black mantilla, in a deep, troubled conference with one of the serving girls about a recent arrival to the inn.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s a sea monster,&#x201d; he heard his hostess whisper. &#x201c;Or a merman. Can they survive on land?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good morning, ladies,&#x201d; Magnus called out. &#x201c;Sounds like my guest has arrived.&#x201d;<br> <br>Both women blinked twice. Magnus put the first blink down to his vivid attire, and the second, slower blink down to what he had just said. He gave them both a cheery wave and wandered out through wide wooden doors and across the courtyard into the common room, where he found his fellow warlock Ragnor Fell skulking in the back of the room with a mug of chicha de molle.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have what he&#x2019;s having,&#x201d; Magnus said to the serving lady. &#x201c;No, wait a moment. I&#x2019;ll have three of what he&#x2019;s having.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell them I&#x2019;ll have the same,&#x201d; said Ragnor. &#x201c;I achieved this drink only through some very determined pointing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Magnus did, and when he returned his gaze to Ragnor, he saw that his old friend was looking his usual self: hideously dressed, deeply gloomy, and deeply green of skin. Magnus often gave thanks that his own warlock&#x2019;s mark was not so obvious. It was sometimes inconvenient to have the gold-green, slit-pupilled eyes of a cat, but this was usually easily hidden with a small glamour, and if not, well, there were quite a few ladies&#x2014;and men&#x2014;who didn&#x2019;t find it a drawback.<br> <br>&#x201c;No glamour?&#x201d; Magnus inquired.<br> <br>&#x201c;You said that you wanted me to join you on travels that would be a ceaseless round of debauchery,&#x201d; Ragnor told him.<br> <br>Magnus beamed. &#x201c;I did!&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;Forgive me. I do not see the connection.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have found I have better luck with the ladies in my natural state,&#x201d; Ragnor told him. &#x201c;Ladies enjoy a bit of variety. There was a woman in the court of Louis the Sun King who said none could compare to her &#x2018;dear little cabbage.&#x2019; I hear it&#x2019;s become quite a popular term of endearment in France. All thanks to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>He spoke in the same glum tones as usual. When the six drinks arrived, Magnus seized on them.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be needing all of these. Please bring more for my friend.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There was also a woman who referred to me as her sweet peapod of love,&#x201d; Ragnor continued.<br> <br>Magnus took a deep restorative swallow, looked at the sunshine outside and the drinks before him, and felt better about the entire situation. &#x201c;Congratulations. And welcome to Lima, the City of Kings, my sweet peapod.&#x201d;<br><br> <br><br>After breakfast, which was five drinks for Ragnor and seventeen for Magnus, Magnus took Ragnor on a tour of Lima, from the golden, curled, and carved fa�ade of the archbishop&#x2019;s palace to the brightly colored buildings across the plaza, with their practically mandatory elaborate balconies, where the Spanish had once executed criminals.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought it would be nice to start in the capital. Besides, I&#x2019;ve been here before,&#x201d; Magnus said. &#x201c;About fifty years ago. I had a lovely time, aside from the earthquake that almost swallowed the city.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you have something to do with that earthquake?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ragnor,&#x201d; Magnus reproached his friend. &#x201c;You cannot blame me for every little natural disaster that happens!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t answer the question,&#x201d; Ragnor said, and sighed. &#x201c;I am relying on you to be . . . more reliable and less like you than you usually are,&#x201d; he warned as they walked. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t speak the language.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So you don&#x2019;t speak Spanish?&#x201d; Magnus asked. &#x201c;Or you don&#x2019;t speak Quechua? Or is it that you don&#x2019;t speak Aymara?&#x201d;<br> <br>Magnus was perfectly aware he was a stranger everywhere he went, and he took care to learn all the languages so he could go anywhere he chose. Spanish had been the first language that he had learned to speak, after his native language. That was the one tongue he did not speak often. It reminded him of his mother, and his stepfather&#x2014;reminded him of the love and the prayer and despair of his childhood. The words of his homeland rested a little too heavily on his tongue, as if he had to mean them, had to be serious, when he spoke.<br> <br>(There were other languages&#x2014;Purgatic and Gehennic and Tartarian&#x2014;that he had learned so that he could communicate with those from the demon realms, languages he was forced to use often in his line of work. But those reminded him of his blood father, and those memories were even worse.)<br> <br>Sincerity and gravity, in Magnus&#x2019;s opinion, were highly overrated, as was being forced to relive unpleasant memories. He would much rather be amused and amusing.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t speak any of the things that you just said,&#x201d; Ragnor told him. &#x201c;Although, I must speak Prattling Fool, since I can understand you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That is hurtful and unnecessary,&#x201d; Magnus observed. &#x201c;But of course, you can trust me completely.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t leave me here without guidance. You have to swear, Bane.&#x201d;<br> <br>Magnus raised his eyebrows. &#x201c;I give you my word of honor!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I will find you,&#x201d; Ragnor told him. &#x201c;I will find whatever chest of absurd clothes you have. And I will bring a llama into the place where you sleep and make sure that it urinates on everything you possess.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There is no need to get nasty about this,&#x201d; Magnus said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. I can teach you every word that you need to know right now. One of them is &#x2018;fiesta.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> <br>Ragnor scowled. &#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>Magnus raised his eyebrows. &#x201c;It means &#x2018;party.&#x2019; Another important word is &#x2018;juerga.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does that word mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>Magnus was silent.<br> <br>&#x201c;Magnus,&#x201d; said Ragnor, his voice stern. &#x201c;Does that word also mean &#x2018;party&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>Magnus could not help the sly grin that spread across his face. &#x201c;I would apologize,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Except that I feel no regret at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Try to be a little sensible,&#x201d; Ragnor suggested.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re on holiday!&#x201d; said Magnus.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re always on holiday,&#x201d; Ragnor pointed out. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been on holiday for thirty years!&#x201d;<br> <br>It was true. Magnus had not been settled anywhere since his lover died&#x2014;not his first lover, but the first one who had lived by his side and died in his arms. Magnus had thought of her often enough that the mention of her did not hurt him, her remembered face like the distant familiar beauty of stars, not to be touched but to shine in front of his eyes at night.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t get enough adventure,&#x201d; Magnus said lightly. &#x201c;And adventure cannot get enough of me.&#x201d;<br> <br>He had no idea why Ragnor sighed again.<br><br> <br><br>Ragnor&#x2019;s suspicious nature continued to make Magnus very sad and disappointed in him as a person, such as when they visited Lake Yarinacocha and Ragnor&#x2019;s eyes narrowed as he demanded: &#x201c;Are those dolphins pink?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They were pink when I got here!&#x201d; Magnus exclaimed indignantly. He paused and considered. &#x201c;I am almost certain.&#x201d;<br> <br>They went from costa to sierra seeing all the sights of Peru. Magnus&#x2019;s favorite was perhaps the city of Arequipa, a piece of the moon, made of sillar rock that when touched by the sun blazed as dazzling and scintillating a white as moonlight striking water.<br> <br>There was a very attractive young lady there too, but in the end she decided she preferred Ragnor. Magnus could have lived his whole long life without becoming involved in a warlock love triangle, or hearing the endearment &#x201c;adorable pitcher plant of a man&#x201d; spoken in French, which Ragnor did understand. Ragnor, however, seemed very pleased and for the first time did not seem to regret that he&#x2019;d come when Magnus had summoned him to Lima.<br> <br>In the end Magnus was able to persuade Ragnor away from Arequipa only by introducing him to another lovely young lady, Giuliana, who knew her way in the rain forest and assured them both that she would be able to lead them to ayahuasca, a plant with remarkable magical properties.<br> <br>Later Magnus had cause to regret choosing this particular lure as he pulled himself through the green swathes of the Manu rain forest. It was all green, green, green, everywhere he looked. Even when he looked at his traveling companion.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like the rain forest,&#x201d; Ragnor said sadly.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because you are not open to new experiences in the same way I am!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, it is because it is wetter than a boar&#x2019;s armpit and twice as smelly here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Magnus pushed a dripping frond out of his eyes. &#x201c;I admit you make an excellent point and also paint a vivid picture with your words.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was not comfortable in the rain forest, that much was true, but it was wonderful there all the same. The thick green of the undergrowth was different from the delicate leaves on trees higher up, the bright feathery shapes of some plants gently waving at the ropelike strands of others. The green all around was broken up by sudden bright interruptions: the vivid splash of flowers and the rush of movement that meant animals instead of leaves.<br> <br>Magnus was especially charmed by the sight of the spider monkeys above, dainty and glossy with long arms and legs spread out in the trees like stars, and the shy swift spring of squirrel monkeys.<br> <br>&#x201c;Picture this,&#x201d; said Magnus. &#x201c;Me with a little monkey friend. I could teach him tricks. I could dress him in a cunning jacket. He could look just like me! But more monkey-shaped.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your friend has gone mad and giddy with the altitude sickness,&#x201d; Giuliana announced. &#x201c;We are many feet above sea level here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Magnus was not entirely sure why he had brought a guide, except that it seemed to calm Ragnor down. Other people probably dutifully followed their guides in unfamiliar and potentially dangerous places, but Magnus was a warlock and fully prepared to have a magical battle with a jaguar demon if that was required. It would be an excellent story, which might impress some of the ladies who were not inexplicably allured by Ragnor. Or some of the gentlemen.<br> <br>Lost in picking fruit and in the contemplation of jaguar demons, Magnus looked around at one point and found himself separated from his companions&#x2014;lost in the green wilderness.<br> <br>He paused and admired the bromeliads, huge iridescent flower-like bowls made out of petals, shimmering with color and water. There were frogs inside the jewel-bright recesses of the flowers.<br> <br>Then he looked up into the round brown eyes of a monkey.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello, companion,&#x201d; said Magnus.<br> <br>The monkey made a terrible sound, half snarl and half hiss.<br> <br>&#x201c;I begin to rather doubt the beauty of our friendship,&#x201d; said Magnus.<br> <br>Giuliana had told them not to back down when approached by monkeys, but to stay still and preserve an air of calm authority. This monkey was much larger than the other monkeys Magnus had seen, with broader bunched shoulders and thick, almost black fur&#x2014;a howler monkey, Magnus remembered they were called.<br> <br>Magnus threw the monkey a fig. The monkey took the fig.<br> <br>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; said Magnus. &#x201c;Let us consider the matter settled.&#x201d;<br> <br>The monkey advanced, chewing in a menacing fashion.<br> <br>&#x201c;I rather wonder what I am doing here. I enjoy city life, you know,&#x201d; Magnus observed. &#x201c;The glittering lights, the constant companionship, the liquid entertainment. The lack of sudden monkeys.&#x201d;<br> <br>He ignored Giuliana&#x2019;s advice and took a smart step back, and also threw another piece of fruit. The monkey did not take the bait this time. He coiled and rattled out a growl, and Magnus took several more steps back and into a tree.<br> <br>Magnus flailed on impact, was briefly grateful that nobody was watching him and expecting him to be a sophisticated warlock, and had a monkey assault launched directly to his face.<br> <br>He shouted, spun, and sprinted through the rain forest. He did not even think to drop the fruit. It fell one by one in a bright cascade as he ran for his life from the simian menace. He heard it in hot pursuit and fled faster, until all his fruit was gone and he ran right into Ragnor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have a care!&#x201d; Ragnor snapped.<br> <br>&#x201c;In my defense, you are quite well camouflaged,&#x201d; Magnus pointed out, and then he detailed his terrible monkey adventure twice, once for Giuliana in Spanish, and again for Ragnor in English.<br> <br>&#x201c;But of course you should have retreated at once from the dominant male,&#x201d; Giuliana said. &#x201c;Are you an idiot? You are extremely lucky he was distracted from ripping out your throat by the fruit. He thought you were trying to steal his females.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Pardon me, but we did not have the time to exchange that kind of personal information,&#x201d; Magnus said. &#x201c;I could not have known! Moreover, I wish to assure both of you that I did not make any amorous advances on female monkeys.&#x201d; He paused and winked. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t actually see any, so I never got the chance.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ragnor looked very regretful about all the choices that had led to his being in this place and especially in this company. Later he stooped and hissed, low enough so Giuliana could not hear and in a way that reminded Magnus horribly of his monkey nemesis: &#x201c;Did you forget that you can do magic?&#x201d;<br> <br>Magnus spared a moment to toss a disdainful look over his shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am not going to ensorcel a monkey! Honestly, Ragnor. What do you take me for?&#x201d;<br><br> <br><br>Life could not be entirely devoted to debauchery and monkeys. Magnus had to finance all the drinking somehow. There was always a Downworlder network to be found, and he had made sure to make the right contacts as soon as he&#x2019;d set foot in Peru.<br> <br>When his particular expertise was called for, he brought Ragnor with him. They boarded the ship in the Salaverry harbor together, both dressed in their greatest finery. Magnus was wearing his largest hat, with an ostrich feather plume.<br> <br>Edmund Garc�a, one of the richest merchants in Peru, met them on the foredeck. He was a man with a florid complexion, dressed in an expensive-looking cassock, knee breeches, and a powdered wig. An engraved pistol hung from his leather belt. He squinted at Ragnor. &#x201c;Is that a sea monster?&#x201d; he demanded.<br> <br>&#x201c;He is a highly respected warlock,&#x201d; said Magnus. &#x201c;You are, in fact, getting two warlocks for the price of one.&#x201d;<br> <br>Garc�a had not made his fortune by turning his nose up at bargains. He was instantly and forevermore silent on the subject of sea monsters.<br> <br>&#x201c;Welcome,&#x201d; he said instead.<br> <br>&#x201c;I dislike boats,&#x201d; Ragnor observed, looking around. &#x201c;I get vilely seasick.&#x201d;<br> <br>The turning green joke was too easy. Magnus was not going to stoop to make it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Would you care to elaborate on what this job entails?&#x201d; he asked instead. &#x201c;The letter I received said you had need of my particular talents, but I must confess that I have so many talents that I am not sure which one you require. They are all, of course, at your disposal.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You are strangers to our shores,&#x201d; said Edmund. &#x201c;So perhaps you do not know that the current...</p><h2>Secrets Never Die (Morgan Dane, 5)</h2><p><p><b>A <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Washington Post</i>, and Amazon Charts bestseller.</b></p><p><b>In the fifth book of the multimillion-copy bestselling series, Morgan Dane and Lance Kruger fight for the innocence of a young murder suspect&#x2014;if only they could find him.</b></p><p>When a retired sheriff&#x2019;s deputy is shot to death in his home, his troubled teenage stepson, Evan, becomes the prime suspect.

Any- way, I do have some idea. I have been conducting extensive empirical investigations on drunkenness ever since the tender age of fourteen. In many ways, I like to think of myself as being a sort of latter-day St. Augustine who asked, &#x201c;What then is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know.&#x201d; Substitute the word <i>drunkenness </i>for <i>time </i>and you pretty much have my saintly position.</p><p>I&#x2019;m aware of some basic medical facts. A couple of gin and tonics will impair your reflexes; a dozen or so will reacquaint you with your lunch and make it difficult to stand up, and an uncertain number, which I am unwilling to investigate, will kill you. But that&#x2019;s not what we know (in an Augustinian way) drunkenness is. Certainly, if an alien knocked on my door and asked why people across this peculiar planet keep drinking alcohol, I wouldn&#x2019;t answer, &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s just to impair our reflexes. It&#x2019;s basically to stop us getting too good at Ping-Pong.&#x201d;</p><p>There&#x2019;s another canard which is usually trotted out at this point, that alcohol lowers your inhibitions. Nothing could be further from the truth. I do all sorts of things when I&#x2019;m squiffy that I never <i>wanted </i>to do when sober. I can talk for hours to people that, sober, I would consider tedious. I recall once leaning out of the window of a flat in Camden Town waving a crucifix about and telling passersby to repent. This isn&#x2019;t something that I long to do when sober but just don&#x2019;t have the nerve for.</p><p>Anyway, some of alcohol&#x2019;s effects are not caused by alcohol. It&#x2019;s terribly easy to hand out nonalcoholic beer without telling people that it contains no alcohol. You then watch them drink and take notes. Sociologists do this all the time, and the results are consistent and conclusive. First, you can&#x2019;t trust a sociologist at the bar; they must be watched like hawks. Second, if you come from a culture where alcohol is meant to make you aggressive, you get aggressive. If you come from a culture where it&#x2019;s meant to make you religious, you become religious. You can even change this from drinking session to drinking session. If the devious sociologist announces that they&#x2019;re investigating liquor and libido, everyone gets libidinous; if they say it&#x2019;s about song, everyone suddenly bursts out singing.</p><p>People even alter their behavior depending on what species of booze they think they&#x2019;re imbibing. Even though the active ingredient&#x2014;ethanol&#x2014;is identical, people will alter their behavior depending on the origins and cultural associations of the tipple in question. English people are very likely to get aggressive after a few pints of lager, but give them wine&#x2014;which is associated with poshness and France&#x2014;and they will become demure, urbane and, in serious cases, sprout a beret. There&#x2019;s a reason we have lager- louts but not vermouth-vandals or Campari-contrarians.</p><p>Some people get very angry when you tell them this. They insist that alcohol causes whatever it is that they don&#x2019;t like&#x2014;let&#x2019;s say violence. If you point out that cultures where alcohol is banned are still violent, they harrumph. If I point out, which I can, that I drink an awful lot more than most, but that I haven&#x2019;t hit anyone since the age of about eight (before intoxicating liquors had ever touched my pacific lips), they say, &#x201c;Well, yes, but what about other people?&#x201d; It&#x2019;s always other people, damn them&#x2014;other people are hell. But most people are able to drink all evening at a nice dinner party without once stabbing the guest on their right.</p><p>And, in the unlikely event that you were suddenly transported to another time and place, an Ancient Egyptian would probably be very surprised that you weren&#x2019;t drinking to receive a vision of the lion-headed goddess Hathor&#x2014;I thought <i>everyone </i>did that. And a Neolithic shaman would wonder why you weren&#x2019;t communicating with the ancestors. A Suri of Ethiopia would probably ask why you hadn&#x2019;t started work yet. That&#x2019;s what Suri people do when they drink; as the saying goes, &#x201c;Where there is no beer, there is no work.&#x201d; Just as an incidental technical point, this is called transitional drinking: drinking to mark the transition from one bit of the day to the other. In England we drink because we&#x2019;ve finished working, the Suri drink because they&#x2019;ve started.</p><p>To put this all another way, when Margaret Thatcher died she was not buried with all her wineglasses and a corner-shop&#x2019;s worth of booze. We think this normal. In fact, we&#x2019;d think it odd if she had been. But we are the odd ones, we&#x2019;re the weirdos, we&#x2019;re the eccentrics. For most of known human history political leaders have been buried with all things needful for a good postmortem piss-up. That goes all the way back to King Midas, to Proto- Dynastic Egypt, to the shamans of Ancient China and, of bloody course, to the Vikings. Even those who have long stopped breathing like to get trolleyed now and then&#x2014; just ask the Tiriki tribe of Kenya, who go and pour beer onto their ancestors&#x2019; graves just in case.</p><p>Drunkenness is near universal. Almost every culture in the world has booze. The only ones that weren&#x2019;t too keen&#x2014;North America and Australia&#x2014;have been colonized by those who were. And at every time and in every place, drunkenness is a different thing. It&#x2019;s a celebration, a ritual, an excuse to hit people, a way of making decisions or ratifying contracts, and a thousand other peculiar practices. When the Ancient Persians had a big political decision to make they would debate the matter twice: once drunk, and once sober. If they came to the same conclusion both times, they acted.</p><p>That is what this book is about. It&#x2019;s not about alcohol per se, it&#x2019;s about drunkenness: its pitfalls and its gods. From Ninkasi, the Sumerian goddess of beer, to the 400 drunken rabbits of Mexico.</p><p>A couple of points should be made before we set off. First, this is a <i>short </i>history. A complete history of drunkenness would be a complete history of humanity and require much too much paper. Instead, I have decided to pick certain points in history to see how people went about getting sozzled. What was it actually like in a Wild West saloon, or a medieval English alehouse, or a Greek symposium? When an Ancient Egyptian girl wanted to go out on the lash what exactly did she do? Of course, each evening is different, but it&#x2019;s possible to get a good, if hazy, notion.</p><p>History books like to tell us that so-and-so was drunk, but they don&#x2019;t explain the minutiae of drinking. Where was it done? With whom? At what time of day? Drinking has always been surrounded by rules, but they rarely get written down. In present-day Britain, for example, though there is no law in place, absolutely everybody knows that you must not drink before noon, except, for some reason, in airports and at cricket matches.</p><p>But in the middle of the rules is unruly drunkenness. The anarchist at the cocktail party. She (I think it&#x2019;s a she, deities of drink usually are) is the one I want to watch. Ideally, I&#x2019;d like to arrest her and take her mugshot, but I&#x2019;m not sure it&#x2019;s possible. At least then, when that curious alien asked me what drunkenness was, I would have something to show.</p></p><h2>Burn Your Goals: The Counter Cultural Approach to Achieving Your Greatest Potential</h2><p>Our counter cultural approach to mental training has helped transform leaders in sports, business, and education.

Then, let's invite others to the fountain of living water offered freely by our Master Teacher whose life and death changes everything."</p><p><b>Trevin Wax&nbsp;</b>is managing editor of The Gospel Project at LifeWay Christian Resources, a pastor, contributor to&nbsp;<i>Christianity Today</i>, and the author of previous books including&nbsp;<i>Counterfeit Gospels</i>and&nbsp;<i>Holy Subversion</i>. Trevin lives with his wife and children in Nashville.It's often said that the pulpit drives the church. Often overlooked is the role of gifted, godly teachers and leaders of small groups. The church needs not only pastors and preachers who point us to Jesus, but also teachers and leaders who overflow with love for Christ and love for the lost. <i>Gospel-Centered Teaching</i> will help accomplish this important goal. Superbly written, it is an accessible and helpful guide for leaders who want to ensure that their teaching of the written Word is always pointing others to the Living Word. This will be an extremely valuable tool for the building up of the Body of Christ.<i>&nbsp;</i><b>Danny Akin</b>President of The Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, NC&nbsp;Pastors, if you are looking for a small book of great impact to give to all your teachers and group leaders this year, Gospel Centered Teaching by Trevin Wax is it. Written to help teachers ground their task in Christ, this book points them to a big God and his sufficient Word, not easy shortcuts or new methods. You will love it and love how much it helps your teachers.&nbsp;<b>Jason Duesing</b><b>V</b>ice President for Strategic Initiatives and Assistant Professor of Historical Theology at The Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Fort Worth, TX&nbsp;A helpful resource steeped in good theology and imminently accessible. Perfect for those looking to teach practical insight in the context of the grand narrative.&nbsp;<b>J.D. Greear</b>Pastor of Summit Church in Raleigh, NC and author of&nbsp;<i>Gospel: Recovering the Power that Made Christianity Revolutionary</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Stop&nbsp;Asking Jesus Into Your Heart: How to Know For Sure You Are Saved</i>.&nbsp;Many of us teach the Bible using our instincts&#x2014;instincts honed through years of Sunday School lessons and small group discussions that focused on how to follow the example of a biblical character or how to apply what we&#x2019;ve read to our lives right now. To overcome these instincts we&#x2019;ve got to become convinced there is a better way and provided with tools to retrain them. That&#x2019;s just what&nbsp;Gospel Centered Teaching&nbsp;provides. Whether you've been teaching for years or are just getting started, you'll gain something from this accessible book. I sure did.&nbsp;<b>Nancy Guthrie</b>Author of the&nbsp;<i>Seeing Jesus in the Old Testament</i>&nbsp;Bible study series<b>&nbsp;</b><i>Gospel-Centered Theology</i> has fast become a popular term in American Christianity to call us back to the role of the power of Jesus in every area of life. Yet it also has become an unclear genre within American Christianity. &nbsp;In many ways it has become a movement, but in other ways it has become a fad. Hopefully in our generation, we will see the LORD use this movement in the grand scheme of people coming to know Jesus for the first time and believers understanding that we grow by that same gospel. &nbsp;That is why, Trevin's resource&nbsp;Gospel-Centered Teaching&nbsp;is a great aid to serve pastor's, teacher's, and disciple makers. &nbsp;Whenever there is a movement, there has to be resources that serve, resource, and focus it for longterm sustainability. &nbsp;Hopefully this resource will be used to do this in our time and beyond.&nbsp;<b>Eric Mason </b>Lead Pastor of Epiphany Fellowship and President of Thriving<i>&nbsp;</i>Bible teachers or small group leaders often ask a lot of questions in order to grow in their craft. Trevin raises the question teachers should ask: How can one center every message on Jesus and what he has done? I'll be handing out this wonderful resource to many folks because Trevin explains the what, why, and how of Gospel-centered teaching so clearly and concisely.&nbsp;<b>Tony Merida</b>Pastor of Imago Dei Church in Raleigh, NC&nbsp;At some point every preacher, teacher or small group leader will hear someone express disappointment with their teaching by suggesting that he or she want to &#x201c;go deeper.&#x201d; &nbsp;While these disappointed Bible students may not really know what they mean by &#x201c;going deeper,&#x201d; I suspect they may have a correct notion that something&#x2019;s missing from our teaching. &nbsp;If we begin a quest to find &#x201c;what&#x2019;s&#x201d; missing, we&#x2019;ll likely embark on an endless search for &#x201c;new and better&#x201d; methods and curricula. &nbsp;In Gospel-Centered Teaching, Trevin Wax wisely points us to the right question &#x2013; &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s missing?&#x201d; &nbsp;The answer, of course, is Jesus. &nbsp;When we ask &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s missing?&#x201d; from our preaching/teaching, we&#x2019;ll embark on a quest to find Christ in all of Scripture. &nbsp;In this short, conversational, and extremely practical book, Trevin serves as an excellent guide who leads us to understand how to teach the Bible with Christ as our focus, the gospel as our center and the entire Bible as one big story about Jesus. &nbsp;If you want to teach a Christian lesson or preach a Christian sermon that glorifies our Savior and leads the church to live on mission, then you&#x2019;ll want to read this book!&nbsp;<b>Juan R. Sanchez, Jr.</b>Preaching Pastor at High Pointe Baptist Church, Austin, TX&nbsp;Theologically robust teaching and missional passion don't have to be at odds with each other. Properly understood, solid teaching fuels mission because it leads us to Jesus Christ, the Son of God who was sent and now sends. Trevin Wax has given us a brief, easy-to-understand guide to what it means to be focused on Christ in our teaching. I recommend pastors give the book to all their volunteer leaders and teachers.

While many contemporary readers seek the richness of classical spirituality, some find the language and thought patterns of <i>The Imitation of Christ</i> distant and difficult to understand. Fr. Dennis Billy, noted teacher and spiritual guide, helps today's readers interpret The Imitation by raising their awareness of how the world of Thomas � Kempis colored and shaped his presentation of the spiritual life.<br><br>Using the accessible translation of <i>The Imitation of Christ</i> by William Creasy, Fr. Billy highlights how today's Christians can interpret and apply <i>The Imitation</i> to their own spiritual journeys. Each chapter is preceded by a brief introduction and followed by a set of thoughtful reflection questions that help readers understand and apply the text.</p><p><strong>Thomas � Kempis (1380&#x2013;1471)</strong> was a medieval Dutch monk steeped in the mystical tradition of his time. A member of the Brothers of the Common Life, he was ordained a priest in 1413. His well-loved work, <em>The Imitation of Christ</em>, was written between 1420 and 1427 presumably as four booklets intended to instruct the novices of his community. It is one of Christian history&#x2019;s best-known works on spiritual devotion. This small book sidesteps academic pretension to consider larger truths. &#x201c;A poor peasant who serves God,&#x201d; Thomas wrote, &#x201c;is better than a proud philosopher who . . . ponders the courses of the stars.&#x201d;<br><strong>Father Dennis Billy, C.Ss.R.</strong>, is a teacher, writer, and poet. Ordained a Redemptorist priest in 1980, he taught the history of moral theology and Christian spirituality at the Alphonsian Academy of Rome&#x2019;s Pontifical Lateran University for more than twenty years, reaching the rank of Ordinary Professor. In 2008 he was installed as the John Cardinal Krol Chair of Moral Theology as a scholar-in-residence at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania. He also serves as the Karl Rahner Professor of Catholic Theology at the Graduate Theological Foundation in Mishawaka, Indiana. Raised in Staten Island, New York, and educated there through high school in local Catholic schools, he graduated from Dartmouth College and went on to receive four master's degrees, as well as doctorates from Harvard University, the Pontifical University of St. Thomas, and the Graduate Theological Foundation.

The stories of the fiery furnace and Daniel in the lion&#x2019;s den are the staples of children&#x2019;s Bible storybooks and Sunday school classes. Yet the latter chapters of Daniel&#x2019;s vision are more unfamiliar and daunting to most believers, who may have been exposed to a variety of end-times speculations constructed from an amalgam of these texts and others drawn from elsewhere in the Bible.<br><br>But Iain M. Duguid reminds Christians that Daniel gives us more than moral lessons or a prophetic timetable. The whole of the book points us to Christ, whether as the one greater than Daniel who has perfectly lived an exilic life of service and separation for us or as the exalted heavenly Son of Man who took flesh amongst us.<br><br>As are all the books in the Reformed Expository Commentary series, this exposition of Daniel is accessible to both pastors and lay readers. Each volume in the series provides exposition that gives careful attention to the biblical text, is doctrinally Reformed, focuses on Christ through the lens of redemptive history, and applies the Bible to our contemporary setting.</p><p><b>Iain M. Duguid</b> (PhD, University of Cambridge) is professor of Old Testament at Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia. He has written numerous works of biblical exposition, including <i>Esther &amp; Ruth</i> and in the Reformed Expository Commentary series."I&#x2019;m a pastor, not a scholar. When you read Iain Duguid, it is clear he is both. Like his other works, this commentary is a rare blend of insightful exegesis and discerning application. What&#x2019;s more, with Iain&#x2019;s guidance you&#x2019;ll find the glories of Christ shining through texts that can otherwise appear obscure and irrelevant. This book will educate pastors, edify Christians, and advance the proclamation of the gospel." --<b>C. J. Mahaney</b>, Sovereign Grace Ministries<br><br>"It is rare indeed to find a technical scholar who is also a master homiletician and preacher. But these things Dr. Iain Duguid clearly is. Here, rigorous expository methodology, nuanced biblical theology, and pastoral passion combine to expound the gospel of Jesus Christ in the ravishing narrative and exotic apocalyptic of the book of Daniel. Readers will be grateful for the reverence and care given to the sacred text, plus the wise application to today's church midst her Babylons. This is a must-read for anyone desiring to understand and live in the dazzling light of Daniel. Warmly commended." --<b>R. Kent Huhges</b>, College Church, Wheaton, IL<br><br>"Here is exposition modeled by pastors with scholarly gifts and by scholars with pastors&#x2019; hearts. Exegetical and theological reliability, redemptive-historical sensitivity, a Christ-centered focus, and contemporary practical application&#x2014;these are the promised hallmarks of the series. May it serve as a model to encourage and enthuse a new generation to love the Word of God and to rediscover the life-transforming power of expository preaching! --<b>Sinclair Ferguson</b>, First Presbyterian Church, Columbia, SC</p><h2>The French Revolution</h2><p><p><strong>A vital and illuminating look at this profoundly important (and often perplexing) historical moment, by former <em>Financial Times</em> chief foreign affairs columnist Ian Davidson.</strong></p> The French Revolution casts a long shadow, one that reaches into our own time and influences our debates on freedom, equality, and authority. Yet it remains an elusive, perplexing historical event. Its significance morphs according to the sympathies of the viewer, who may see it as a series of gory tableaux, a regrettable slide into uncontrolled anarchy&#x2015;or a radical reshaping of the political landscape.<br><br> In this riveting new book, Ian Davidson provides a fresh look at this vital moment in European history. He reveals how it was an immensely complicated and multifaceted revolution, taking place in different places, at different times, and in different spheres; and how subsequently it became weighted with political, social, and moral values. Stirring and dramatic&#x2015;and filled with the larger-than-life players of the period and evoking the turbulence of this colorful time&#x2015;this is narrative history at its finest.<br></p><p>After graduating in Classics from Cambridge, <strong>Ian Davidson</strong> worked for the <em>Financial Times</em> for many years as their Paris correspondent and chief foreign affairs columnist. He is also the author of <em>Voltaire</em> (Pegasus) and <em>Voltaire in Exile</em> (Grove). Ian lives in England.&#x201c;More than 200 years later, the world&#x2019;s first true working-class revolution is little-enough understood that a new, nuts-and-bolts history, subtly but importantly reframed, feels essential and sadly all-too-relevant. The terror that followed feels inevitable today, but Davidson shows that it wasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Vulture (7 Books You Need to Read This December)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;What we don't know about the French Revolution could fill a book; Davidson has done just that&#x2015;in spades. An invaluable history of the French Revolution and its repercussions through the years&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An even-handed, step-by-step account of key moments of the French Revolution. A serious work of popular history, challenging enough to intrigue those already familiar with the revolution and accessible enough to engage those who are not.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Shelf Awareness</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Davidson aims to correct modern misperceptions of the French Revolution that toppled the ancien r�gime in 1789 and ushered in the First Republic.

Sixteen detailed chapters, organized chronologically, examine the evolution of gangster rap, its main players, and the culture that created this revolutionary music. From still-swirling conspiracy theories about the murders of Biggie and Tupac to the release of the 2015 film <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>, the era of gangster rap is one that fascinates music junkies and remains at the forefront of pop culture. Filled with interviews with key players such as Snoop Dogg, Ice-T, and dozens more, as well as sidebars, breakout bios of notorious characters, lists, charts, and more, <i>The History of Gangster Rap </i>is the be-all-end-all book that contextualizes the importance of gangster rap as a cultural phenomenon.</p><p><b>Soren Baker</b> has written thousands of articles about music and culture for such outlets as the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times,</i> and <i>Rolling Stone,</i> among others. He is currently producing a script he wrote for Snoop Dogg.

(The D.O.C.)<br><br>"Hip-hop changed the world. Gangster rap changed the narrative, and then changed the world again.

(Xzibit)<br><br>"Soren Baker has changed the perspective of gangster rap by putting his pen to paper. He has given hip-hop power, proven its potential, and made non-believers contemplate all of its possibilities. The truth in his writing leaves no stone unturned, something he's done again with <i>The History of Gangster Rap</i>. Soren doesn&#x2019;t just champion hip-hop. He also reveals its flaws and its truths." (Leslie &#x201c;Big Lez&#x201d; Segar)<br><br>"This book is a masterclass that takes the reader through the meager beginnings of gangster rap&#x2019;s origins all the way to its position today as rap&#x2019;s most important and impactful subgenre. Soren&#x2019;s knowledge of the topic is seen throughout each page and the artists&#x2019; trust in him is shown throughout thoughtful anecdotes and recollections. A highly recommended book for anyone who has a cursory interest in those who trailblazed and popularized the art. You&#x2019;ll leave with a much deeper appreciation for its impact and influence."

This must change to ensure a capitalism that works for us all.<br><br><i>Shortlisted for the FT &amp; McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award</i><br></b><br>A scathing indictment of our current global financial system, <i>The Value of Everything</i> rigorously scrutinizes the way in which economic value has been accounted and reveals how economic theory has failed to clearly delineate the difference between value creation and value extraction. Mariana Mazzucato argues that the increasingly blurry distinction between the two categories has allowed certain actors in the economy to portray themselves as value creators, while in reality they are just moving around existing value or, even worse, destroying it. <br><br>The book uses case studies-from Silicon Valley to the financial sector to big pharma-to show how the foggy notions of value create confusion between rents and profits, reward extractors and creators, and distort the measurements of growth and GDP. In the process, innovation suffers and inequality rises. <br><br>The lesson here is urgent and sobering: to rescue our economy from the next inevitable crisis and to foster long-term economic growth, we will need to rethink capitalism, rethink the role of public policy and the importance of the public sector, and redefine how we measure value in our society.<br></p><p><b>Mariana Mazzucato</b> is professor in the Economics of Innovation and Public Value at University College London (UCL), where she directs the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose.

The Ghost in the Machine looks at the dark side of the coin: our terrible urge to self-destruction...</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Could the human species be a gigantic evolutionary mistake? To answer that startling question Koestler examines how experts on evolution and psychology all too often write about people with an &#x2018;antiquated slot-machine model based on the naively mechanistic world-view of the nineteenth century. His brilliant polemic helped to instigate a major revolution in the life sciences, yet its &#x2018;glimpses of an alternative world-view&#x2019; form only the background to an even more challenging analysis of the human predicament. Perhaps, he suggests, we are a species in which ancient and recent brain structures - or reason and emotion - are not fully co-ordinated. Such in-built deficiencies may explain the paranoia, violence and insanity that are central strands of human history. And however disturbing we find such issues, Koestler contends, it is only when we face our limitations head-on that we can hope to find a remedy.</p></p><p></p><h2>Relaxing with God: The Neglected Spiritual Discipline</h2><p>Jesus called his followers to exchange the heavy yoke around their necks for his light one.

Tripp goes to work gently exposing our murky motivations and secret longings, and then he brings the gospel to bear&#x2015;the gospel of grace which renews us and changes us. He does so with humility and care, but also with insight and wisdom. Don&#x2019;t expect to find help with your budgeting, but do expect help to walk a path of contentment and to grow in generosity.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Graham Beynon,</strong> Pastor, Grace Church, Cambridge; Director of Independent Ministry Training, Oak Hill College, London; author, <em>Money Counts</em></p><p>&#x201c;If you want to win with money, <i>Redeeming Money</i> is for you!

It grows wild in twenty-six states, gracing Eastern forests each fall with sweet-smelling, tropical-flavored abundance. Historically, it fed and sustained Native Americans and European explorers, presidents, and enslaved African Americans, inspiring folk songs, poetry, and scores of place names from Georgia to Illinois. Its trees are an organic grower&#x2019;s dream, requiring no pesticides or herbicides to thrive, and containing compounds that are among the most potent anticancer agents yet discovered.<br> <br> So why have so few people heard of the pawpaw, much less tasted one?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> In <em>Pawpaw</em>&#x2015;a 2016 James Beard Foundation Award nominee in the Writing &amp; Literature category&#x2015;author Andrew Moore explores the past, present, and future of this unique fruit, traveling from the Ozarks to Monticello; canoeing the lower Mississippi in search of wild fruit; drinking pawpaw beer in Durham, North Carolina; tracking down lost cultivars in Appalachian hollers; and helping out during harvest season in a Maryland orchard. Along the way, he gathers pawpaw lore and knowledge not only from the plant breeders and horticulturists working to bring pawpaws into the mainstream (including Neal Peterson, known in pawpaw circles as the fruit&#x2019;s own &#x201c;Johnny Pawpawseed&#x201d;), but also regular folks who remember eating them in the woods as kids, but haven&#x2019;t had one in over fifty years.&nbsp;<br> <br> As much as <em>Pawpaw</em> is a compendium of pawpaw knowledge, it also plumbs deeper questions about American foodways&#x2015;how economic, biologic, and cultural forces combine, leading us to eat what we eat, and sometimes to ignore the incredible, delicious food growing all around us. If you haven&#x2019;t yet eaten a pawpaw, this book won&#x2019;t let you rest until you do.</p></p><p><p>Andrew Moore<strong>&nbsp;</strong>grew up in Lake Wales, Florida, just south of the pawpaw&#x2019;s native range. A writer and gardener, he now lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was the news editor and a feature writer for&nbsp;<em>Pop City</em>, a weekly news e-magazine in Pittsburgh, and his stories have been published in the&nbsp;<em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Daily Yonder</em>, and the&nbsp;<em>Biscayne Times</em>.&nbsp;<em>Pawpaw&nbsp;</em>is his&nbsp;first book.</p><p><em>"</em>I&#x2019;m always eager to read a talented writer&#x2019;s first book. For one thing, it&#x2019;s full of the infectious passion for the subject that usually drives someone to write it in the first place. But more than that, authors devote to such books the kind of attention usually reserved for a firstborn child&#x2015;they are scrutinized and fretted over to the finest detail.&nbsp;<em>Pawpaw</em>, a heartfelt paean to a native North American tree with edible fruits, is just such a book. I have been growing pawpaws since 1970, but never realized how much I didn&#x2019;t know about the tree until reading Andrew Moore&#x2019;s book. A skilled storyteller, Moore delves deeply into the world of pawpaws while managing to hold the reader&#x2019;s interest through detail after detail.

Hoping to shed more light on this culinary mystery, as well as inspire consumers and growers to make the fruit popular again, first-time author and gardener Moore offers both an engaging history and a thorough cultivation guide to the pawpaw. According to Moore, the shrub-like, large-leafed pawpaw tree typically grows in clumps near river bottoms along a belt running from northern Missouri to southern Louisiana and east as far as the Atlantic Ocean. Although historically pawpaw was eaten by Native Americans and slaves, it probably owes its marketplace anonymity to a short shelf life and widely variable flavors. While it remains to be seen whether Moore&#x2019;s well-written paean to the pawpaw will inspire increased production and distribution to grocery stores, uninitiated readers will be intrigued enough to want to sample the fruit at the first opportunity.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Here is proof that culinary odysseys don&#x2019;t always need to involve globetrotting or the pursuit of rare, exotic foodstuffs.

G. Jung Foundation Books Series)</h2><p>Although alchemy is popularly regarded as the science that sought to transmute base physical matter, many of the medieval alchemists were more interested in developing a discipline that would lead to the psychological and spiritual transformation of the individual. C. G. Jung discovered in his study of alchemical texts a symbolic and imaginal language that expressed many of his own insights into psychological processes. In this book, Marie-Louise von Franz examines a text by the sixteenth-century alchemist and physician Gerhard Dorn in order to show the relationship of alchemy to the concepts and techniques of analytical psychology. In particular, she shows that the alchemists practiced a kind of meditation similar to Jung&#39;s technique of active imagination, which enables one to dialogue with the unconscious archetypal elements in the psyche. Originally delivered as a series of lectures at the C. G. Jung Institute in Zurich, the book opens therapeutic insights into the relations among spirit, soul, and body in the practice of active imagination.</p><p>Marie-Louise von Franz (1915&#x2013;1998) was the foremost student of C. G. Jung, with whom she worked closely from 1934 until his death in 1961. A founder of the C. G. Jung Institute of Zurich, she published widely on subjects including alchemy, dreams, fairy tales, personality types, and psychotherapy."Von Franz has a remarkable gift for interpreting and demystifying the difficult symbolism of religious visions, ancient myths, and fairy tales of the common folk. Whether explaining the psychic complexities of gender or racial conflict, or the survival value of our connection to other animals, von Franz is perhaps unsurpassed as the archetypal Jungian."&#x2014; <i>Library Journal </i></p><h2>Breakthrough: Eight Steps to Wellness</h2><p><b>Are you thriving...or do you need a health BREAKTHROUGH? </b> <br><br>People are suffering and many haven&#x2019;t had access to the treatment they truly need to get better.

But much has changed since it was last updated in 1999, as the United States reels from political, economic, and demographic shifts, all of which impact nonprofit organizations every day. In the current economy, nonprofits are trying to make ends meet. They are responding to technological innovation in the age of social media and viral marketing. Nonprofit administrators, trustees, and volunteers need Thomas Wolf&#x2019;s solid advice now more than ever. So do the many college and university students preparing for work in the nonprofit arena.<br> <br>Dr. Wolf&#x2019;s update of <i>Managing a Nonprofit Organization</i> includes material that tackles the demands and challenges faced by nonprofit managers as a result of the legislative and policy changes enacted after 9/11 and in the wake of the economic collapse of 2008. Highlighting the generational issues facing many nonprofits, as current management ages and a younger generation prepares to take the reins, Dr. Wolf suggests ways for organizations to best manage these transitions and adapt to a rapidly changing world. In easy-to-understand language and with study questions at the end of each chapter, Dr. Wolf explains how to cope with all the changes, giving you everything you need to know to be a highly successful nonprofit leader.</p><p>Dr. Thomas Wolf&#39;s career spans over four decades and encompasses the fields of philanthropy, education and the arts. He established the Cambridge office of WolfBrown in 1983 after serving as the founding Director of the New England Foundation for the Arts. His clients have included ten of the fifty largest U.S. foundations, government agencies such as the National Endowment for the Arts, and treasured international cultural institutions like the British Museum, the Boston Symphony Orchestra and The Kennedy Center. Dr. Wolf is the author of numerous articles and books. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<b>ONE</b><br> <br><b>Understanding Nonprofit Organizations</b><br><br>The Spencer family lives in a small city in the western United States. Sam Spencer runs a plumbing supply business; Jane, his wife, teaches at a school for the learning disabled. On a typical day, their lives&#x2014;like the lives of most Americans&#x2014;are touched repeatedly by the world of nonprofit organizations.<br><br>� At 7:30 A.M., Jane takes Sammy Jr., aged three, to a day-care center housed at the Baptist church to which the family belongs. She then goes directly to her school, which serves learning-disabled high school students. The day-care center, the church, and the school are all nonprofit organizations.<br> <br>� At about the same time that Jane leaves, Sam is loading his truck with plumbing supplies for the regional hospital, which is located in their city. The hospital, which employs more than a thousand people, is also a nonprofit organization, one that makes a significant contribution to the local economy.<br> <br>� Before leaving home, Sam reminds son John, aged nine, that he should pack his bathing suit and towel because there is swim practice after school at the local YMCA. The YMCA is the city&#x2019;s principal recreational organization and is organized as a nonprofit.<br> <br>� On this particular day, Jane is on release time from the classroom, taking an in-service workshop on language arts instruction at the local college. The college is the largest nonprofit organization in the city.<br> <br>� While Jane is on release time, half of her students are on a field trip to the science museum, and the other half are attending an open rehearsal at the local symphony. Both of these organizations are nonprofits.<br> <br>� Meanwhile, Sam has completed his delivery of plumbing supplies and drives over to the job training center where he teaches the essentials of plumbing two mornings a week. Although supported almost exclusively with government funding, the center is a nongovernment, private nonprofit organization.<br> <br>� When school is over, Jane meets with a group of teachers who are working on a special grant proposal that they will submit to a local foundation. They are seeking funds to support a computer-based language arts program in their classrooms. The foundation, whose income is derived mainly from a large endowment and is exempt from taxation, is a nonprofit organization.<br> <br>� After leaving school, Jane drives over to a local nursing home to visit her father. The nursing home is a nonprofit organization.<br> <br>� Sam leaves work early to go to a public hearing. A local builder, one of Sam&#x2019;s customers, has proposed a new development in what was formerly marshland. An environmental group, organized as a nonprofit organization, is opposing the development and is presenting its testimony at the public hearing.<br> <br>� When Jane arrives home, there is a letter from daughter Amy, who is spending the fall of her junior year in South America as part of an exchange program. The exchange was organized by a national nonprofit organization with a local chapter in the city where the Spencers live.<br> <br>� Finally, after dinner, the Spencers receive a call from the public radio station. It is pledge week, and the caller asks whether the Spencers will renew their membership in this nonprofit organization. Jane leaves soon after for a planning meeting for the local Girl Scouts&#x2019; cookie drive. The Girl Scouts is a prominent national nonprofit organization.<br><br>There are over 1.5 million nonprofit organizations in the United States, a number that has increased by over 30 percent in the past decade.1 This includes public charities active in health care, religion, culture, education, human services, and the environment. It also includes advocacy organizations, labor unions, business and professional associations, and social and recreational clubs. The public charities, identified with the special 501(c)(3) designation by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS), alone number over a million organizations. This subsector grew by 64 percent over the decade from 1999 to 2009.<br> <br>Many of these nonprofit organizations have relatively small operating budgets. Indeed, fully 45 percent of the sector in 2008 had budgets of under $100,000. Move up to the $500,000 level, and almost three quarters of the organizations had budgets less than that. Fewer than 5 percent have budgets of over $10 million, though they account for 85 percent of all expenditures.2<br> <br>With so many small organizations, what is their financial impact? Actually it is quite dramatic. In total, the sector&#x2019;s spending was approximately 11 to 12 percent of the nation&#x2019;s gross domestic product in 2007.3 Based on 2008 statistics, nonprofits employ over 15 million people, or 13 percent of all private-sector workers.4 But beyond this, their contribution to the nation&#x2019;s quality of life is incalculable. American households contributed nearly $2,000 per year of their personal money5 to nonprofits plus substantially more in contributed hours. In fact, at the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century, over 63 million Americans (27 percent of the population) volunteered their time to nonprofit organizations with an estimated value of over $278 billion.6<br> <br>Despite the tremendous size and impact of the nonprofit sector, it is not well understood by most people. The purpose of this chapter is to describe what nonprofit organizations are, what distinctive features they possess, and what special challenges they pose for the people who manage and govern them.<br> <br><b>WHAT IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION?</b><br> <br>Suppose you asked someone, &#x201c;What is an elephant?&#x201d; and the person answered, &#x201c;An elephant is a nonhorse.&#x201d; You would probably find the answer unsatisfactory. Yet, the term nonprofit organization describes something that is not something else&#x2014;it suggests a business enterprise not organized to make a profit. But it tells us very little about the essential characteristics of this type of entity.<br> <br>It is not easy to describe nonprofit organizations, and this is partly what makes managing them such a difficult task fraught with challenges and problems. Unlike management issues in the profit sector, which tend to be clear and related to specific economic measures, issues in the nonprofit environment are more nebulous because they relate to the somewhat abstract concept of public service. In a profit-making company, a manager generally knows whether he or she is doing a good job, but it is often less clear in a nonprofit organization in which the primary purpose is not to make money but to serve the public.<br> <br>Some say that the essential defining characteristic of nonprofit organizations is the fact that they are established to provide a service to the public, and to some extent this is true. But this idea of a public service mission can be misleading. For one thing, there are a number of nonprofit organizations that are not organized to serve the public (for example, country clubs and labor unions). For another, the idea that nonprofit organizations are simply organized to solve some societal problem or deliver some much-needed public service flies in the face of the exclusivity often associated with their respective constituencies. This is perhaps most clear when nonprofit organizations are compared to public (or government) organizations and agencies working in the same area of activity. Although the nonprofit organizations often have a stated public service mission, they do not necessarily have a requirement of equity (that is, a mandate to serve everyone) the way public agencies usually do. As a result, the nonprofit organization&#x2019;s actual constituency may be far more limited than that of a public agency working in the same field.<br> <br>Others claim that the essential defining characteristic of nonprofit organizations is that their mission is not to make money. Again, this is partly true. But many nonprofit organizations are quite entrepreneurial (again, this distinguishes them from most public or governmental agencies working in the same field). Many nonprofits engage in all sorts of money-making ventures that bear a close resemblance to profit-making entities, and this has been cause for some concern among those working in commercial endeavors whose businesses must compete with nonprofits for customers.<br> <br>In fact, a nonprofit organization is neither in the for-profit sector nor in the public sector but sits somewhere between the two. This position allows the nonprofit great flexibility in its operation but also requires great skill in its management. On the one hand, managers must learn the same management techniques and analytical strategies that apply in profit-making companies. However, while these techniques are relevant in the nonprofit world, their application is dissimilar. Although both profit-making and nonprofit organizations engage in planning, budgeting, accounting, and marketing; although both have to contend with issues of governance, personnel, and information management; and although both have to raise money from time to time, these activities are carried out in markedly different ways. Similarly, while it may be useful to know about the workings of a public agency and the development of public policy, it is not sufficient preparation for the nonprofit manager or trustee. Governance, organizational accountability, financial reporting, and long-range planning are very different in nonprofit organizations whose special defining characteristics are laid down in state and federal law.<br> Toward a Definition<p></p> <br>In this book, the term nonprofit organization refers to those legally constituted, nongovernmental entities incorporated under state law as charitable or not-for-profit corporations that have been set up to serve some public purpose and are tax-exempt according to the IRS. All must have the following five characteristics:<br><br>� They must have a public service mission.<br> <br>� They must be organized as a not-for-profit or charitable corporation.<br> <br>� Their governance structures must preclude self-interest and private financial gain.<br> <br>� They must be exempt from paying federal tax.<br> <br>� They must possess the special legal status that stipulates gifts made to them are tax deductible.<br><br>Consequently, nonprofit organizations as described in this book do not include three other categories of organizations:<br><br>� Entities that have been set up to make a profit but are failing to do so<br> <br>� Organizations that are governed informally by a collection of people who, although they have banded together to serve some public good, have been granted no special corporate status by federal and state authorities<br> <br>� Organizations that are recognized as nonprofit by the IRS but do not have a public purpose (for example, trade associations, labor unions, country clubs, and fraternal organizations)<br><br>Because these various classes of organizations do not have all the characteristics previously listed, their missions, governance structures, or method of management may be significantly different from what is described in this book.<br> <br>This chapter considers four major challenges that face nonprofit organizations as a consequence of these special characteristics. The challenges are:<br><br>� Articulating a clear public service mission<br> <br>� Engaging in risk/survival analysis<br> <br>� Identifying and involving the constituency<br> <br>� Testing for &#x201c;Organized Abandonment&#x201d;<br><br>By looking closely at each of these, we will continue to refine our understanding of the special nature of nonprofit organizations.<br> <br><b>CONSEQUENCES OF A PUBLIC SERVICE MISSION</b><br> <br>An essential difference between for-profit and nonprofit organizations centers on the concept of mission. The ultimate mission of the profit-making entity is to earn money for its owners. Ownership can come in many forms, of course, from outright ownership of the organization by a single individual to shared ownership (by partners or shareholders or some other group). The concept of ownership is completely absent from nonprofit organizations, and consequently the nonprofit&#x2019;s mission has a totally different thrust. There can be no owners in a nonprofit organization, because such an entity is intended to serve a broad public purpose and the law is clear in specifying that ownership (with concomitant private gain) is incompatible with public purpose. This is not to say that nonprofit organizations cannot make money. Nonprofit organizations can and do make money&#x2014;in the same way profit-making entities do&#x2014;but the money that is taken in must be directed toward the public purpose for which the organization was set up, held in reserve, or turned over to another organization with a public purpose.<br> <br>It is much more difficult to identify and articulate the mission of a nonprofit organization and consequently to develop criteria by which success can be measured. In a profit-making organization, because the mission is clear, success criteria are also clear. The mission centers on profitability; thus the criteria for success (and for decision making) include the bottom line, return on investment, sales, profit margins, market share, and other easily calculated measures. In a nonprofit organization, where the mission centers on public service, it is not only more difficult to define purposes, but it can be a bewildering task to try to find the proper yardstick by which to measure success. If the purpose of a school is to produce well-educated citizens, if a peace group is established to oppose the use of military force, if a recreation center is to offer constructive activities to urban teenagers, what criteria should each use to measure success? There will always be quantitative measures at hand&#x2014;College Board scores for the school, statistics on attendance at political rallies for the peace group, and numbers of participating teenagers in the case of the recreation center&#x2014;but these measures are only indirect indexes of success.<br> <br>Because the missions of nonprofit organizations center on the concept of public service, one might look to the public sector for models that demonstrate how mission statements are articulated and tested. Unfortunately, there is a problem with this approach. In the public sector, as we have already seen, there is an implied or stated mandate of equity in every mission statement. That is, public agencies are obligated to serve anyone who is eligible for assistance. For that reason, quantitative measures of success are often possible on the basis of the numbers of people served, their geographic distribution, their racial and socioeconomic diversity, and the cost-effectiveness of service delivery. For nonprofit organizations, these criteria may be relevant, but more often than not they are only indirect measures of success. Consider a nonprofit university-affiliated teaching hospital. Unlike the public hospital down the street, it cannot directly measure its success by counting the numbers of patients served and the cost-effectiveness of medical treatment. The nonprofit hospital&#x2019;s mission of promoting excellence in medical practice through exemplary training is less concrete, and success criteria are more difficult to establish.<br> <br>Thus we come to the first major challenge for a nonprofit organization&#x2014;that of articulating a clear public service mission. The challenge is not only to come up with a statement that defines what the organization is and what it has been set up to do, but to state these things in such a way that the organization can evaluate its success in carrying out this mission over time.<br> Developing a Mission Statement<p></p> <br>The challenge of developing a good mission statement includes creating a text that is sufficientl...</p><h2>Wildfire: A Hidden Legacy Novel (Hidden Legacy, 3)</h2><p><p><strong><em>From&nbsp;Ilona Andrews, #1&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>New York Times<em>&nbsp;bestselling author, the thrilling conclusion to her Hidden Legacy series, as Nevada and Rogan grapple with a power beyond even </em>their<em>&nbsp;imagination...</em></strong></p><p>Nevada Baylor can&#x2019;t decide which is more frustrating&#x2014;harnessing her truthseeker abilities or dealing with Connor &#x201c;Mad&#x201d; Rogan and their evolving relationship.

Ilona is a native-born Russian and Gordon is a former communications sergeant in the U.S. Army.

These classic tales are full of wit, humor, and creativity, and Julius Lester brings an added contemporary sense to these forty-eight timeless stories.</p><p><b>Julius Lester </b>is a celebrated author whose accolades include a Newbery Honor and a Coretta Scott King Award. He is also a National Book Award finalist, a National Book Critics Circle nominee, and a recipient of the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award.

Jerry Pinkney lives with his wife, author Gloria Jean Pinkney, in Westchester County, New York.Grade 2 Up Recent retellings of Joel Chandler Harris' African-American folktales from former slaves have pruned the dialect and leave out Uncle Remus all together. Most notable of these is Jump!: the Adventures of Brer Rabbit (HBJ, 1986). This newest attempt brings together two distinguished children's book creators in a most unusual recreation. Lester has retold 48 of the folktales in standard English but with a strong feel for the dialect of the original stories. His retellings are as lively as the originals but they also have a liveliness of their own, as he incorporates modern allusions which never seem out of place. Even more importantly, he uses the sharp, witty Uncle Remus who narrated the original folktales, and not the more servile character from the opening and closing segments who many found offensive. Pinkney's illustrations are mostly black-and-white sketches with some full-color double-page spreads. They do not have the sass of the original A. B. Frost illustrations, but they are filled with strong interest and a great humor which serves the text well. This will be of great interest to school and public libraries as well as to storytellers as a source which gives new life to an American classic.

Part of the library of books found in Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945, this central myth of Gnosticism tells the story of how God fell from perfect Oneness to imprisonment in the material world, and how by knowing our divine nature and our divine origins&#x2015;that we are one with God&#x2015;we reverse God's descent and find our salvation.</p><p><em>The Secret Book of John: The Gnostic Gospel&#x2015;Annotated &amp; Explained </em>decodes the principal themes, historical foundation, and spiritual contexts of this challenging yet fundamental Gnostic teaching. Drawing connections to Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, kabbalistic Judaism, and Sufism, Davies focuses on the mythology and psychology of the Gnostic religious quest. He illuminates the Gnostics' ardent call for self-awareness and introspection, and the empowering message that divine wholeness will be restored not by worshiping false gods in an illusory material world but by our recognition of the inherent divinity within ourselves.</p><p>Now you can experience and understand this foundational teaching even if you have no previous knowledge of Gnosticism. This SkyLight Illuminations edition presents the most important and valued book in Gnostic religion with insightful yet unobtrusive commentary. It provides deeper insight into the understanding that in Gnosticism the distinction between savior and saved ceases to exist&#x2015;you must save yourself and in doing so save God.</p></p><p>The Gnostic history of God comes to life <p>"The ultimate goal of humanity is to come to understand this myth, the gospel of the Secret Book of John, in such a way that the pattern of devolution from the fullness of God to humanity&#x2019;s imprisonment in matter is reversed. To understand the events of our fall reveals to us a map for our journey of ascent. We will emerge free from matter ... return to an established position in the mind of God, and never leave again." &#x2014;from the Introduction </p><p>"Gnosis is the yeast that lifts the dough of revelation above the arid flatland of religious convention.

But it is about more than history alone--it illuminates the present and unveils the future. Prophetic in nature, the book reveals how God wants to work in each of our lives to fulfill His purposes--today, tomorrow, and in the years to come.<br> The stories in this collection of God-encounters carry a prophetic anointing for all who have ears to hear. Author Bill Johnson highlights the significant traits and contributions of many well-known revival leaders, including John Wesley, Charles Finney, Dwight L. Moody, Maria Woodworth-Etter, Carrie Judd Montgomery, Smith Wigglesworth, John G. Lake, Evan Roberts, Rees Howells, Aimee Semple McPherson, Kathryn Kuhlman, Randy Clark, and Heidi Baker. He explains the impact these leaders can have on us today as we respond to the life-changing truths revealed through their life stories.<br> There is power in knowing the testimonies of men and women who experienced God in a<i> defining moment</i> and said yes to His unique call on their lives. It is a power that inspires us to hunger for God in such a way that we, too, will have an encounter with Him that launches us into the world of the "impossible," enabling us to fulfill a greater measure of our destiny. Read this book with a sense of readiness, and watch what happens.<br></p><p><b>Bill Johnson</b> is a fifth-generation pastor who lives a life rich in the things of the Spirit, using heaven as a model for his life and ministry. In 1968, at the end of his high school years, he moved from the Los Angeles area to Redding, California, where his parents became the pastors of Bethel Church, and two years later, the Holy Spirit began to move powerfully in that community of believers. It was about this time that Mario Murillo visited the church, speaking about being absolutely abandoned to Christ. One Saturday night, Bill said yes to God&#x2014;the absolute yes&#x2014;and everything changed for him.<br> In 1978, Bill was invited to pastor Mountain Chapel in Weaverville, California, and he served there for seventeen years. The presence of God was very strong, and the church extended its times of worshipping and glorifying God, even though, in the first years, they saw few miracles, despite praying for many. Bill&#x2019;s greatest breakthrough in ministry came after attending two conferences in 1987 organized by John Wimber. Bill realized he needed to &#x201c;put a demand&#x201d; on what he believed&#x2014;his risk factor had to line up with the boldness of his beliefs. As he did this, there was an immediate change in his ministry, and the church began to see an increase in healing and miracles.<br> Bill moved back to Bethel Church in Redding in 1996, where he and his wife, Beni, are the senior pastors. An outpouring of the Spirit began almost immediately. It grew rapidly, and there were many healings, including, in multiple cases, of cancer. Today, healings and miracles are the norm at Bethel. Bill and Beni have a heart to see the values of the kingdom of heaven fill the earth. Together, they serve a growing number of churches that have partnered together to work toward global revival.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Ethics for Addiction Professionals</h2><p><b>Guidance for addiction counselors in understanding and applying ethical standards</b> <p>Filled with proven strategies to help you examine your current practice for ethical snags and refresh your ethical thinking, <i>Ethics for Addiction Professionals</i> leads you in examining, building, and rebuilding aspects of your ethical practice with the goal of helping you become the strongest clinician possible&#x2015;ethically speaking.Up-to-date and comprehensive, this practical guide examines real-life examples of ethical issues in clinical practice and illustrates potential pitfalls and the actions needed when faced with dilemmas.

She lives in Tacoma Park, MD. <br><br>Ira Block has photographed on assignment for the <i>National Geographic</i> magazine, Traveler magazine, and <i>National Geographic Adventure.</i> He lives in New York City.Just in time for the 400th anniversary of the Jamestown settlement, this well-illustrated volume presents information based on recent archaeology at the site of the original fort. Lange clearly describes conditions in early Jamestown and tells how the recent excavations and other research have shifted historians' perceptions of the colony. She also discusses the Indians who lived in the area before the English settlement began and shows how their views of the settlers changed over the years. The excellent color photos feature interpreters dressed as colonists and Indians in reconstructions of their communities as well as artifacts found at the site of the fort. In conclusion, Lange tackles some controversy, noting "the story of Jamestown is not a comforting one: Indians see nothing to celebrate in the 400th year commemoration." Jamestown has long been overshadowed by Plymouth in America's mythology, but this forthright narrative is a very good place to start learning its significant story.

Calling someone a fascist is the fastest way to shut them up, defining their views as beyond the political pale. But who are the real fascists in our midst?<br><br><i>Liberal Fascism</i> offers a startling new perspective on the theories and practices that define fascist politics. Replacing conveniently manufactured myths with surprising and enlightening research, Jonah Goldberg reminds us that the original fascists were really on the left, and that liberals from Woodrow Wilson to FDR to Hillary Clinton have advocated policies and principles remarkably similar to those of Hitler's National Socialism and Mussolini's Fascism.<br><br>Contrary to what most people think, the Nazis were ardent socialists (hence the term &#x201c;National socialism&#x201d;). They believed in free health care and guaranteed jobs. They confiscated inherited wealth and spent vast sums on public education. They purged the church from public policy, promoted a new form of pagan spirituality, and inserted the authority of the state into every nook and cranny of daily life. The Nazis declared war on smoking, supported abortion, euthanasia, and gun control. They loathed the free market, provided generous pensions for the elderly, and maintained a strict racial quota system in their universities&#x2014;where campus speech codes were all the rage. The Nazis led the world in organic farming and alternative medicine. Hitler was a strict vegetarian, and Himmler was an animal rights activist.<br><br>Do these striking parallels mean that today&#x2019;s liberals are genocidal maniacs, intent on conquering the world and imposing a new racial order? Not at all. Yet it is hard to deny that modern progressivism and classical fascism shared the same intellectual roots. We often forget, for example, that Mussolini and Hitler had many admirers in the United States. W.E.B. Du Bois was inspired by Hitler's Germany, and Irving Berlin praised Mussolini in song. Many fascist tenets were espoused by American progressives like John Dewey and Woodrow Wilson, and FDR incorporated fascist policies in the New Deal.<br><br>Fascism was an international movement that appeared in different forms in different countries, depending on the vagaries of national culture and temperament. In Germany, fascism appeared as genocidal racist nationalism. In America, it took a &#x201c;friendlier,&#x201d; more liberal form. The modern heirs of this &#x201c;friendly fascist&#x201d; tradition include the<i> New York Times</i>, the Democratic Party, the Ivy League professoriate, and the liberals of Hollywood. The quintessential Liberal Fascist isn't an SS storm trooper; it is a female grade school teacher with an education degree from Brown or Swarthmore.<br><br>These assertions may sound strange to modern ears, but that is because we have forgotten what fascism is. In this angry, funny, smart, contentious book, Jonah Goldberg turns our preconceptions inside out and shows us the true meaning of Liberal Fascism.</p><p>JONAH GOLDBERG is a columnist for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> and contributing editor to <i>National Review</i>.

Germany passed its hateful race policies&#x2014;the Nuremberg Laws&#x2014;in 1935, and Mussolini&#x2019;s Italy followed suit in 1938. German Jews were rounded up in 1942, and Jews in Italy were rounded up in 1943. A few writers will casually mention, in parenthetical asides, that until Italy passed its race laws there were actually Jews serving in the Italian government and the Fascist Party. And on occasion you&#x2019;ll notice a nod to historical accuracy indicating that the Jews were rounded up only <i>after</i> the Nazis had invaded northern Italy and created a puppet government in Salo. But such inconvenient facts are usually skipped over as quickly as possible. More likely, your understanding of these issues comes from such sources as the Oscar&#x2013;winning film <i>Life Is Beautiful</i>, (2) which can be summarized as follows: Fascism arrived in Italy and, a few months later, so did the Nazis, who carted off the Jews. As for Mussolini, he was a bombastic, goofy&#x2013;looking, but highly effective dictator who made the trains run on time.<br><br>All of this amounts to playing the movie backward. By the time Italy reluctantly passed its shameful race laws&#x2014;which it never enforced with even a fraction of the barbarity shown by the Nazis&#x2014;over 75 percent of Italian Fascism&#x2019;s reign had already transpired. A full sixteen years elapsed between the March on Rome and the passage of Italy's race laws. To start with the Jews when talking about Mussolini is like starting with FDR&#x2019;s internment of the Japanese: it leaves a lot of the story on the cutting room floor. Throughout the 1920s and well into the 1930s, fascism meant something very different from Auschwitz and Nuremberg. Before Hitler, in fact, it never occurred to anyone that fascism had anything to do with anti&#x2013;Semitism. Indeed, Mussolini was supported not only by the chief rabbi of Rome but by a substantial portion of the Italian Jewish community (and the world Jewish community). Moreover, Jews were overrepresented in the Italian Fascist movement from its founding in 1919 until they were kicked out in 1938.<br><br>Race did help turn the tables of American public opinion on Fascism. But it had nothing to do with the Jews. When Mussolini invaded Ethiopia, Americans finally started to turn on him. In 1934 the hit Cole Porter song &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the Top&#x201d; engendered nary a word of controversy over the line &#x201c;You are Mussolini!&#x201d; When Mussolini invaded that poor but noble African kingdom the following year, it irrevocably marred his image, and Americans decided they had had enough of his act. It was the first war of conquest by a Western European nation in over a decade, and Americans were distinctly unamused, particularly liberals and blacks. Still, it was a slow process. The <i>Chicago Tribune</i> initially supported the invasion, as did reporters like Herbert Matthews. Others claimed it would be hypocritical to condemn it. The <i>New Republic</i>&#x2014;then in the thick of its pro&#x2013;Soviet phase&#x2014;believed it would be &#x201c;naive&#x201d; to blame Mussolini when the real culprit was international capitalism. And more than a few prominent Americans continued to support him, although quietly. The poet Wallace Stevens, for example, stayed pro&#x2013;Fascist. &#x201c;I am pro&#x2013;Mussolini, personally,&#x201d; he wrote to a friend. &#x201c;The Italians,&#x201d; he explained, &#x201c;have as much right to take Ethiopia from the coons as the coons had to take it from the boa&#x2013;constrictors.&#x201d; (3) But over time, largely due to his subsequent alliance with Hitler, Mussolini&#x2019;s image never recovered.<br><br>That's not to say he didn't have a good ride.<br><br>In 1923 the journalist Isaac F. Marcosson wrote admiringly in the <i>New York Times</i> that &#x201c;Mussolini is a Latin [Teddy] Roosevelt who first acts and then inquires if it is legal. He has been of great service to Italy at home.&#x201d; (4) The American Legion, which has been for nearly its entire history a great and generous American institution, was founded the same year as Mussolini&#x2019;s takeover and, in its early years, drew inspiration from the Italian Fascist movement. &#x201c;Do not forget,&#x201d; the legion&#x2019;s national commander declared that same year, &#x201c;that the Fascisti are to Italy what the American Legion is to the United States.&#x201d; (5)<br><br>In 1926 the American humorist Will Rogers visited Italy and interviewed Mussolini. He told the <i>New York Times</i> that Mussolini was &#x201c;some Wop.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty high on that bird.&#x201d; Rogers, whom the National Press Club had informally dubbed &#x201c;Ambassador&#x2013;at&#x2013;Large of the United States,&#x201d; wrote up the interview for the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>. He concluded, &#x201c;Dictator form of government is the greatest form of government: that is if you have the right Dictator.&#x201d; (6) In 1927 the Literary Digest conducted an editorial survey asking the question: &#x201c;Is there a dearth of great men?&#x201d; The person named most often to refute the charge was Benito Mussolini&#x2014;followed by Lenin, Edison, Marconi, and Orville Wright, with Henry Ford and George Bernard Shaw tying for sixth place. In 1928 the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> glorified Mussolini even further, running an eight&#x2013;part autobiography written by Il Duce himself. The series was gussied up into a book that gained one of the biggest advances ever given by an American publisher.<br><br>And why shouldn&#x2019;t the average American think Mussolini was anything but a great man? Winston Churchill had dubbed him the world&#x2019;s greatest living lawgiver. Sigmund Freud sent Mussolini a copy of a book he co&#x2013;wrote with Albert Einstein, inscribed, &#x201c;To Benito Mussolini, from an old man who greets in the Ruler, the Hero of Culture.&#x201d; The opera titans Giacomo Puccini and Arturo Toscanini were both pioneering Fascist acolytes of Mussolini. Toscanini was an early member of the Milan circle of Fascists, which conferred an aura of seniority not unlike being a member of the Nazi Party in the days of the Beer Hall Putsch. Toscanini ran for the Italian parliament on a Fascist ticket in 1919 and didn&#x2019;t repudiate Fascism until twelve years later. (7)<br><br>Mussolini was a particular hero to the muckrakers&#x2014;those progressive liberal journalists who famously looked out for the little guy. When Ida Tarbell, the famed reporter whose work helped break up Standard Oil, was sent to Italy in 1926 by <i>McCall</i>&#x2019;<i>s</i> to write a series on the Fascist nation, the U.S. State Department feared that this &#x201c;pretty red radical&#x201d; would write nothing but &#x201c;violent anti&#x2013;Mussolini articles.&#x201d; Their fears were misplaced. Tarbell was wooed by the man she called &#x201c;a despot with a dimple,&#x201d; praising his progressive attitude toward labor. Similarly smitten was Lincoln Steffens, another famous muckraker, who is today perhaps dimly remembered for being the man who returned from the Soviet Union declaring, &#x201c;I have been over into the future, and it works.&#x201d; Shortly after that declaration, he made another about Mussolini: God had &#x201c;formed Mussolini out of the rib of Italy.&#x201d; As we&#x2019;ll see, Steffens saw no contradiction between his fondness for Fascism and his admiration of the Soviet Union. Even Samuel McClure, the founder of <i>McClure&#x2019;s Magazine</i>, the home of so much famous muckraking, championed Fascism after visiting Italy. He hailed it as &#x201c;a great step forward and the first new ideal in government since the founding of the American Republic.&#x201d; (8)<br><br>Meanwhile, almost all of Italy&#x2019;s most famous and admired young intellectuals and artists were Fascists or Fascist sympathizers (the most notable exception was the literary critic Benedetto Croce). Giovanni Papini, the &#x201c;magical pragmatist&#x201d; so admired by William James, was deeply involved in the various intellectual movements that created Fascism. Papini&#x2019;s <i>Life of Christ</i>&#x2014;a turbulent, almost hysterical tour de force chronicling his acceptance of Christianity&#x2014;caused a sensation in the United States in the early 1920s. Giuseppe Prezzolini, a frequent contributor to the <i>New Republic </i>who would one day become a respected professor at Columbia University, was one of Fascism&#x2019;s earliest literary and ideological architects. F. T. Marinetti, the founder of the Futurist movement&#x2014;which in America was seen as an artistic companion to Cubism and Expressionism&#x2014;was instrumental in making Italian Fascism the world's first successful &#x201c;youth movement.&#x201d; America's education establishment was keenly interested in Italy&#x2019;s &#x201c;breakthroughs&#x201d; under the famed &#x201c;schoolmaster&#x201d; Benito Mussolini, who, after all, had once been a teacher.<br><br>Perhaps no elite institution in America was more accommodating to Fascism than Columbia University. In 1926 it established Casa Italiana, a center for the study of Italian culture and a lecture venue for prominent Italian scholars. It was Fascism&#x2019;s &#x201c;veritable home in America&#x201d; and a &#x201c;schoolhouse for budding Fascist ideologues,&#x201d; according to John Patrick Diggins. Mussolini himself had contributed some ornate Baroque furniture to Casa Italiana and had sent Columbia&#x2019;s president, Nicholas Murray Butler, a signed photo thanking him for his &#x201c;most valuable contribution&#x201d; to the promotion of understanding between Fascist Italy and the United States. (9) Butler himself was not an advocate of fascism for America, but he did believe it was in the best interests of the Italian people and that it had been a very real success, well worth studying. This subtle distinction&#x2014;fascism is good for Italians, but maybe not for America&#x2014;was held by a vast array of prominent liberal intellectuals in much the same way some liberals defend Castro&#x2019;s communist &#x201c;experiment.&#x201d;<br><br>While academics debated the finer points of Mussolini&#x2019;s corporatist state, mainstream America&#x2019;s interest in Mussolini far outstripped that of any other international figure in the 1920s. From 1925 to 1928 there were more than a hundred articles written on Mussolini in American publications and only fifteen on Stalin. (10) For more than a decade the <i>New York Times</i>&#x2019;<i>s</i> foreign correspondent Anne O&#x2019;Hare McCormick painted a glowing picture of Mussolini that made the Times&#x2019;s later fawning over Stalin seem <i>almost</i> critical. The <i>New York Tribune</i> was vexed to answer the question: Was Mussolini Garibaldi or Caesar? Meanwhile, James A. Farrell, the head of U.S. Steel, dubbed the Italian dictator &#x201c;the greatest living man&#x201d; in the world.<br><br>Hollywood moguls, noting his obvious theatrical gifts, hoped to make Mussolini a star of the big screen, and he appeared in <i>The Eternal City</i> (1923), starring Lionel Barrymore. The film recounts the battles between communists and Fascists for control of Italy, and&#x2014;<i>mirabile dictu</i>&#x2014;Hollywood takes the side of the Fascists. &#x201c;His deportment on the screen,&#x201d; one reviewer proclaimed, &#x201c;lends weight to the theory that this is just where he belongs.&#x201d; (11) In 1933 Columbia Pictures released a &#x201c;documentary&#x201d; called <i>Mussolini Speaks</i>&#x2014;supervised by Il Duce himself. Lowell Thomas&#x2014;the legendary American journalist who had made Lawrence of Arabia famous&#x2014;worked closely on the film and provided fawning commentary throughout. Mussolini was portrayed as a heroic strongman and national savior. When the crescendo builds before Mussolini gives a speech in Naples, Thomas declares breathlessly, &#x201c;This is his supreme moment. He stands like a modern Caesar!&#x201d; The film opened to record business at the RKO Palace in New York. Columbia took out an ad in <i>Variety</i> proclaiming the film a hit in giant block letters because &#x201c;it appeals to all RED BLOODED AMERICANS&#x201d; and &#x201c;it might be the ANSWER TO AMERICA'S NEEDS.&#x201d;<br><br>Fascism certainly had its critics in the 1920s and 1930s. Ernest Hemingway was skeptical of Mussolini almost from the start. Henry Miller disliked Fascism&#x2019;s program but admired Mussolini&#x2019;s will and strength. Some on the so&#x2013;called Old Right, like the libertarian Albert J. Nock, saw Fascism as just another kind of statism. The nativist Ku Klux Klan&#x2014;ironically, often called &#x201c;American fascists&#x201d; by liberals&#x2014;tended to despise Mussolini and his American followers (mainly because they were immigrants). Interestingly, the hard left had almost nothing to say about Italian Fascism for most of its first decade. While liberals were split into various unstable factions, the American left remained largely oblivious to Fascism until the Great Depression. When the left did finally start attacking Mussolini in earnest&#x2014;largely on orders from Moscow&#x2014;they lumped him in essentially the same category as Franklin Roosevelt, the socialist Norman Thomas, and the progressive Robert La Follette. (12)<br><br>We&#x2019;ll be revisiting how American liberals and leftists viewed Fascism in subsequent chapters. But first it seems worth asking, how was this possible? Given everything we&#x2019;ve been taught about the evils of fascism, how is it that for more than a decade this country was in significant respects pro&#x2013;fascist? Even more vexing, how is it&#x2014;considering that most liberals and leftists believe they were put on this earth to oppose fascism with every breath&#x2014;that many if not most American liberals either admired Mussolini and his project or simply didn&#x2019;t care much about it one way or the other?<br><br>The answer resides in the fact that Fascism was born of a &#x201c;fascist moment&#x201d; in Western civilization, when a coalition of intellectuals going by various labels&#x2014;progressive, communist, socialist, and so forth&#x2014;believed the era of liberal democracy was drawing to a close. It was time for man to lay aside the anachronisms of natural law, traditional religion, constitutional liberty, capitalism, and the like and rise to the responsibility of remaking the world in his own image. God was long dead, and it was long overdue for men to take His place. Mussolini, a lifelong socialist intellectual, was a warrior in this crusade, and his Fascism&#x2014;a doctrine he created from the same intellectual material Lenin and Trotsky had built their movements with&#x2014;was a grand leap into the era of &#x201c;experimentation&#x201d; that would sweep aside old dogmas and usher in a new age. This was in every significant way a project of the left as we understand the term today, a fact understood by Mussolini, his admirers, and his detractors.

And whether she's writing about smoky, nutty Catalan Romesco sauce, Cordero a la Miel&#x2013;sweet and hot tender lamb stew with honey&#x2013;or the iconic, emblematic national dish of Spain, saffron-perfumed Paella Valenciana, her clear, elegant, humorous, and passionate voice is a reader's delight, a guide not only to delicious food but to the peoples and cultures that produced it.</p><p>Both comprehensive and timeless, <em>The Food of Spain</em> is one of the most important books on this tremendous cuisine to appear in the last fifty years.

Sonny West, Presley's close friend and bodyguard for nearly two decades, provides a firsthand account of the King's lavish spending sprees and many charitable acts, as well as the many affairs Presley conducted with his costars.

It truly shows us how hard it was to be The King." -- Lee Majors <p>"Among all of Elvis Presley's close associates, no one tells stories that are more entertaining than Sonny West.

Burk, Publisher, Elvis World magazine</p>Elvis: Still Taking Care of Business is one of the most authentic portraits ever written about one of the greatest American entertainers. It is a balanced, respectful, and insightful look at Elvis's last two decades written by Sonny West, a true Presley insider and charter member of the infamous Memphis Mafia.<p>West, who worked and played with Presley from 1960 until the year before Elvis's death in 1977, was there for it all. Many books about Presley are written by third parties who never even met the man. Not this book. West was like a brother to Elvis, and has great insight into one of the most beloved, yet complex, figures of the 20th century. Elvis: Still Taking Care of Business is a roller-coaster ride that follows Presley's personal and professional ups and downs, his mercurial temper, his generous spirit, and his tragic decline. Sonny West had a front-row seat for it all, and now so will anyone who reads this book. Included are stories and photographs that have never been published before! A special section on former Memphis Mafia members called "Where Are They Now?" brings fans up-to-date on the lives of Elvis' closest confidants. West also answers some tough questions from fans in a special appendix. Presented in an entirely different tone from West's first book, Elvis: What Happened?, this is a loving, fun, and poignant book that is sure to enthrall Elvis Presley fans around the globe.</p></p><h2>Race to Incarcerate: A Graphic Retelling</h2><p><b>"Do not underestimate the power of the book you are holding in your hands."<br> Michelle Alexander</b> <br> <br>More than 2 million people are now imprisoned in the United States, producing the highest rate of incarceration in the world. How did this happen? As the director of The Sentencing Project, Marc Mauer has long been one of the country&#x2019;s foremost experts on sentencing policy, race, and the criminal justice system. His book <i>Race to Incarcerate</i> has become the essential text for understanding the exponential growth of the U.S. prison system; Michelle Alexander, author of the bestselling <i>The New Jim Crow</i>, calls it "utterly indispensable." Now, Sabrina Jones, a member of the <i>World War 3 Illustrated</i> collective and an acclaimed author of politically engaged comics, has collaborated with Mauer to adapt and update the original book into a vivid and compelling comics narrative. Jones's dramatic artwork adds passion and compassion to the complex story of the penal system&#x2019;s shift from rehabilitation to punishment and the ensuing four decades of prison expansion, its interplay with the devastating "War on Drugs," and its corrosive effect on generations of Americans.<br> <br>With a preface by Mauer and a foreword by Alexander, <i>Race to Incarcerate: A Graphic Retelling</i> presents a compelling argument about mass incarceration&#x2019;s tragic impact on communities of color if current trends continue, one of every three black males and one of every six Latino males born today can expect to do time in prison. The race to incarcerate is not only a failed social policy, but also one that prevents a just, diverse society from flourishing.<br></p><p><b>Sabrina Jones</b> is the author of <i>Isadora Duncan: A Graphic Biography</i> and a contributor to <i>World War 3 Illustrated</i>, <i>Wobblies!</i>, <i>The Real Cost of Prisons</i>, <i>Studs Terkel&#x2019;s</i> Working (The New Press), <i>FDR and the New Deal for Beginners</i>, <i>Yiddishkeit</i>, and <i>Radical Jesus</i>. She lives in Brooklyn, New York. <b>Marc Mauer</b> is the executive director of The Sentencing Project in Washington, D.C. He is the author of <i>Race to Incarcerate</i>, a semifinalist for the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award, and the co-editor, with Meda Chesney-Lind, of <i>Invisible Punishment</i> (both available from The New Press). He lives in the Washington, D.C., area. <b>Michelle Alexander</b> is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The New Jim Crow</i>.<br>Jones channels the tradition of liberal-Left political cartooning to give this graphic documentary a dynamic, woodcut-like look that galvanizes its adaptation of Mauer&#x2019;s tract of the same name. Its subject is imprisonment in the U.S., especially, since the war on drugs was launched in the 1980s, the push to jail as many as possible (as it sometimes seems). Since the opening of the first &#x201c;penitentiary&#x201d; in 1829 and preceded by &#x201c;getting tough on crime&#x201d; policies, the war on drugs has reversed the emphasis on rehabilitation in U.S. prisons. While outlining how the drug war fueled a prison-construction boom, gave the U.S. by far the highest national rate of incarceration in the world, and ensured that more than half those imprisoned are poor blacks and Latinos, Mauer keeps the focus on the politics of crime, a game played with macho glee by both parties. Mauer&#x2019;s original book has been criticized for lacking immediacy (too much passive voice, etc.), but with Jones&#x2019; inspirational help, this version has plenty of punch. Terrific for current-events teaching, too. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Wait for You (Wait for You Saga, 1)</h2><p><p><strong>The #1 New York Times and USA Today bestselling phenomenon</strong></p><p><em>Some things are worth waiting for . . . </em></p><p>Traveling thousands of miles from home to enter college is the only way nineteen-year-old Avery Morgansten can escape what happened at that fateful Halloween party five years ago&#x2014;an event that forever changed her life.

Armentrout). After five hellish years of being called a lying whore in her small Texas town, 19-year-old Avery Morgansten is more than happy to leave for college in West Virginia. There she meets gorgeous, blue-eyed Cameron Hamilton, a fellow student who seems as attracted to her as she is to him. Haunted by her traumatic past, Avery is torn between protecting herself and finding love. The path to romance is long and rocky, and Cam has dark secrets of his own, but eventually both lovers come clean and all loose ends are neatly wrapped up. While Lynn&#39;s peripheral characters are fairly one-dimensional, Avery and Cam are compelling. Fans of stories about characters healed by love will find this one moderately satisfying.

His deep love of the mysterious and frightening began with&nbsp;<i>Unsolved Mysteries&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;The X-Files</i>&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s a love that continues to this day. Basically, he&#x2019;s a nerd for anything inexplicable or supernatural. Mahnke lives with his family in the historic North Shore area of Boston, the very heart of Lovecraft Country and the Salem witch trials.&nbsp;<br> The Castle<br> &nbsp;<br><br>On January 17, 1894, a couple stood before a minister at the Vendome Hotel in Denver, Colorado. Henry Howard and Georgianna Yoke were about to be married. Standing near them was their witness, a woman named Minnie Williams.The bride had come from Indiana to escape a scandalous reputation, and had found work in Chicago at a store owned by Henry. She was a tall, slender woman, about twenty-five years of age, with blue eyes and blond hair. And she was madly in love with Henry.<br> It sounds wonderful. It sounds perfect, actually. But there was trouble in paradise even before they met the minister there at the hotel.<br> You see, Henry was already married. He was, in fact, married to <i>two </i>other women. And Minnie, the woman standing as witness, was actually Henry&#x2019;s mistress of over a year. Even Henry&#x2019;s name was fake; his real name had been abandoned long before, and&nbsp;&nbsp; it would be months before Georgianna would discover who he really was.<br> Sometimes we think we know a person, only to discover that we were fooled. Community is built on trust, and that trust allows each of us to make connections, to let down our guard, and to feel safe. When that trust is broken, though, our minds quickly shift to disappointment and stress and outright fear.<br><br>Sure, it happens less often now in the age of Facebook and social media. But in the late 1800s, very little stood in the way of a person falsifying their identity, and Henry Howard&#x2014;or whoever he was prior to that moment in Denver&#x2014;had turned that skill into an art. Few people knew this about Henry, though. In fact, few people could have imagined what deep, dark secrets boiled just beneath the surface of this smiling young groom. And when the world finally <i>did </i>find out exactly ten months later, they could barely contain their horror.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>Warning Signs <br> Henry Howard was born in New Hampshire in 1861 as Herman Mudgett. His parents were wealthy, well-respected people in their community, and their son was born into that privilege. But from an early age, Herman was a problem child, constantly getting into trouble.<br> According to Mudgett himself, as a child his classmates forced him to view and touch a human skeleton after learning that he was afraid of the town doctor. Their prank backfired, though, generating a deep fascination rather than frightening him off. And that obsession with death would only grow.<br> Soon the boy was expressing interest in medicine. One report claims that he would actually perform surgery on animals. Along with his excellent performance in school, he was able to pursue that interest and enter medical school, enrolling at the University of Michigan as H. H. Holmes in 1879. Far from home, and with access to resources that he previously lacked, college allowed Holmes to get creative.<br> He devised an easy way to make money&#x2014;a drive that would fuel many of his future crimes. It involved stealing a cadaver from the medical lab. Holmes would disfigure the corpse and plant the body somewhere that gave it the appearance of being the victim of a tragic accident. Then, a few days later, he would approach a life insurance company with a policy for his &#x201c;deceased relative&#x201d; and collect the cash.<br><br>His final insurance swindle in Michigan netted him $12,500, but he knew his welcome was wearing thin. After collecting the money, he vanished, abandoning school and his new wife, Clara, and child, who never saw him again.<br> He moved around the country doing legitimate work, but also learning his way around the business world. He mastered the art of buying product on credit, avoiding the bills, selling the items, and then vanishing with the profit. Armed with that skill, he soon settled in Englewood, just south of Chicago.<br> It was 1885. Holmes was trying to avoid creditors from all<br> around the country. But rather than vanish into obscurity, he chose to hide in plain sight. He married his second wife&#x2014;<br> bigamously, of course&#x2014;and took a job at a local drugstore owned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> and run by Dr. Elizabeth Holden, whose husband was dying of cancer.<br> Holmes spent the next two years becoming more and more essential to Holden&#x2019;s business, paying her for ownership in the business and building relationships with the customers. When Mr. Holden finally did pass away, the payments from Holmes stopped, and Dr. Holden became upset, threatening to end their business partnership.<br> But nothing happened&#x2014;because Dr. Holden mysteriously vanished. When asked about her disappearance, Holmes told the authorities that she had moved out west to live with family, right after she had signed over the business to him, of course. And the police bought the lie.<br> Holmes operated the drugstore as if nothing had happened, growing the business and continuing his chess game of evading creditors. But when the empty lot across the street became avail- able, he couldn&#x2019;t resist the temptation. Holmes, you see, had bigger plans. The World&#x2019;s Columbian Exposition was scheduled to be hosted in Chicago in 1893, and he envisioned a hotel that could house the countless visitors who would travel to the area.<br> His project was lovingly called the Castle, which wasn&#x2019;t far from the truth. It was 50 feet wide and more than 160 feet long, taking up half of a city block. With three stories and a basement, it would eventually have over a hundred rooms within its walls.<br><br>And Holmes, ever the micromanager, took on the task of project architect, refusing to share the plans with anyone else.<br> Workers on the building asked questions, naturally, but when they did, Holmes would replace them. Most of the men working on the project never lasted for more than two weeks. All told, more than five hundred carpenters and craftsmen worked on the Castle. True to form, Holmes managed to avoid paying most of them as well. He would accuse them of shoddy work and refuse to give them their wages. Some sued him, but he managed to put those<br> cases off long enough that they eventually gave up.<br> Once the new building was completed, Holmes moved the drugstore to its ground floor and rented out space to other shops.<br> His personal offices were located on the top floor, and the remaining space was rented out as temporary living quarters, marketed as a boardinghouse for young, single women.<br> The Castle was open for business. Unfortunately, not everyone who stayed there managed to survive the hospitality that Holmes offered them.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Gone Girls <br>When Mrs. Pansy Lee arrived from New Orleans, she rented a room at the Castle. She was a widow and had traveled all over the United States before arriving in Chicago to settle down. When Holmes learned that she had $4,000 in cash in the false bottom of her trunk, he kindly offered to keep it in his store vault for her. Mrs. Lee declined the offer, and vanished a short time later.<br> While some people came to the Castle for lodging, others were looking for work. One of the requirements that Holmes imposed was that all his employees were to have life insurance policies for the sum of $5,000. Holmes, remember, knew the life insurance business well.<br> When seventeen-year-old Jennie Thompson arrived from southern Illinois looking for work, Holmes saw an opportunity. She was young and pretty&#x2014;the exact sort of blond-haired, blue- eyed beauty that he preferred&#x2014;and he quickly gave her a job.<br><br>In casual conversation Jennie let it slip that her family didn&#x2019;t actually know where she was. She had told them she was traveling to New York, but the offer of a good job was enough to keep her right there in Chicago. She told Holmes that she couldn&#x2019;t wait to tell her parents about her good fortune. Before she did, though, he escorted her up to her room, and she was never seen again.<br> In 1890, Ned Connor arrived at the Castle looking for work. He<br> traveled with his wife, Julia&#x2014;unusually tall for a woman at nearly six feet&#x2014;and their young daughter, Pearl. Ned was a watchmaker and jeweler, and Holmes hired him right away. But it was Ned&#x2019;s wife who captured his attention the most.<br> Holmes soon fired his bookkeeper and gave the job to Julia. Not<br> long after, it began to be obvious that Holmes was more than a&nbsp;<i>7</i><br> little friendly with Ned&#x2019;s wife. Ned, for his part, turned a blind eye. It seems he was glad to have a good job with steady pay and a roof over his head.<br> When Julia became pregnant, though, Ned took the hint. He packed up, filed for divorce, and left her and Pearl in the care of Holmes, who immediately took out insurance policies on both of them. But Holmes had a new problem: Julia knew the business <i>too </i>well, and she presented a threat to his illicit activities.<br> Holmes found a solution. He told Julia that he would marry her, but only if she would have an abortion. Julia resisted at first, but finally, on December 24, 1891, she gave in. She asked Holmes to put Pearl to bed, and then he led her to the basement, where he had a makeshift operating room.<br> Julia and Pearl were never seen again.<br> That same winter, Holmes summoned a man named Charles Chappell to his office. Chappell performed odd jobs around the Castle, but he had a particular skill that Holmes required. He was incredibly gifted in the craft of articulating skeletons.<br> Chappell arrived, and Holmes led him to a second-floor room, where the body of a woman lay on a table. According to Chappell&#x2019;s own testimony to the authorities, the body had been skinned like a jackrabbit. He assumed, since Holmes was a doctor, that he had simply been performing an autopsy on a patient, and pushed his doubts to the back of his mind.<br><br>Holmes paid Chappell $36 to strip the flesh off the body and prepare the bones for articulation. The finished skeleton was sold to Dr. Pauling of Hahnemann Medical College. Dr. Pauling would often look at the skeleton in his private office and marvel at how unusual it was to see a woman nearly six feet tall.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Murder House <br> Eventually Holmes made a critical mistake. Ironically, it was his old love of insurance scams that caught up with him in the end. After&nbsp; he&nbsp; killed&nbsp; his&nbsp; right-hand&nbsp; man,&nbsp; Benjamin&nbsp; Pitezel,&nbsp; and attempted to pass the death off as an accident to the insurance company, the authorities caught wind of the crime and tracked him down.<br> He was finally arrested in Boston on November 17, 1894, ten<br> months to the day from his wedding ceremony in a Denver hotel. Before his trial began, however, the Castle was mysteriously gut- ted by fire. Thankfully, the authorities had already been able to search the building, and after doing so they had given it a new name: the Murder House.<br> The authorities discovered that, like any boardinghouse of the time, the Castle had a reception room, a waiting room, and many rooms for residents to live in. But the building had more inside its walls than was expected. There were secret chambers, trapdoors, peepholes, and hidden laboratories.<br> Aside from the thirty-five guest rooms, the second floor was a labyrinth of passages. Some doors opened on brick walls, some could only be opened from one side, and others were hidden from sight completely. Trapdoors led to staircases that led to hidden chambers. There were even alarms in all of the rooms that would alert Holmes in his quarters if any of his prisoners tried to escape. Some of the rooms were windowless and could be sealed off and made airtight if necessary. Some were equipped with gas jets that were fed by pipes from the basement. Others were lined with<br> asbestos and had visible scorch marks on the floor.<br><br>Then there was the Vault.<br> It was a room that could fit a single person, and then only if they were standing. The walls inside the Vault were lined with iron plate, broken only by a handful of gas fixtures and a trapdoor that led to a chute. On the inside of the door was a single foot- print, the size of a woman&#x2019;s boot. It was a homemade gas chamber that was designed to deliver corpses straight to the basement.<br> When the police descended to the lowest level of the building, they discovered that Holmes had expanded the basement beyond the foundation of the building and out beneath the sidewalk. He did this to make room for all of his equipment.<br> Here they found the dissection table, still splattered with blood.<br> Jars of&nbsp; poison filled a shelf, and a large wooden box nearby contained multiple female skeletons. Built into one wall was a crematorium, which still contained ash and bone fragments. A search also found valuables that belonged to some of the victims: a watch that belonged to Minnie Williams, scraps of fabric, tintype photo- graphs, and a ball of women&#x2019;s hair, carefully wrapped in cloth.<br> The bones of a child were found buried in a pit, and the remnants of a bloody dress were recovered from a wood-burning stove. When Ned Connor was asked to identify the fabric, he con- firmed it belonged to his wife, Julia.<br> A rack designed to stretch bodies was also discovered. Beneath the dirt floor they found a vat of corrosive acid and two quicklime pits, used for quickly dissolving the flesh off corpses. There were human skulls, a shoulder blade, ribs, a hip socket, and countless other human remains.<br> Whatever the police had hoped to find that day, they were un- prepared for the truth. In the end, they had discovered a medieval charnel house right beneath their feet.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Monsters in Masks <br>It&#x2019;s easy to feel safe in our own neighborhood, walking past the closed doors and manicured lawns. But what goes on behind those&nbsp;walls is never something that we can be sure of. Each and every person we meet wears a mask, and we&#x2019;re only allowed to peek be- hind it if they let us.<br>Society is built on the idea that we can trust the people around us. That we can take our neighbors, our family, even our coworkers at face value and enter into relationships with them. But with every relationship comes risk. We risk disappointment. We risk pain and betrayal. For some of us, we even risk our very safety.<br> European mapmakers of the fifteenth century would some- times mark unexplored areas of their maps with a warning: &#x201c;Here there be monsters.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s danger in the places we haven&#x2019;t explored. And while this was true then of undiscovered continents, it has always been true of humanity. Beneath the surface, behind the mask, hides the monster.<br> On May 7, 1896, after a final meal of boiled eggs, dry toast, and a cup of coffee, H. H. Holmes was led to the gallows at Moyamensing Prison. A black hood was placed over his head, and as the crowd outside the prison walls shouted their insults and jeers, he was positioned over the trapdoor.<br> When it opened, Holmes dropped and his head snapped to the side. But rather than killing him quickly, the rope had somehow broken his neck and left him alive. The crowd watched for over fifteen minutes as Holmes hung from the noose, fingers and feet twitching and dancing, before his heart finally stopped beating.<br> Holmes was buried in an unmarked grave in Holy Cross Cemetery, just south of Philadelphia. As per his request, there was no autopsy, and his body was buried in a coffin filled with cement. Holmes, you see, was afraid that someone ...</p><h2>Stickerbomb Skateboard: 150 Classic Skateboard Stickers</h2><p>Skateboard stickers have always been highly collectable, and this will be the first book to bring together some of the most popular stickers, both classic and new.

Galenos&#x2019;s daughter, Ariadne, has lived with her oppressive mother and grandfather in a villa near Athens ever since her parents&#x2019; divorce as a child. Now 16, she flees to her father&#x2019;s home in Corinth, where she quickly discovers the family secret: her father is the famous Honorable Thief, who robs only the richest and most unscrupulous citizens. Ariadne faces challenges in her new life, among them the displeasure of the city&#x2019;s women who think she is ridiculous when she enters a prestigious race at the Isthmian Games, as well as the contentious relationship with her foster brother, Theo. Despite this, she is bent on helping her father, even if it means becoming a thief herself. But then, abruptly, Galenos and Ariadne&#x2019;s lives are transformed when Ariadne&#x2019;s brother, Dionysus, arrives from Athens with his friend, Paul of Tarsus. Paul&#x2019;s teachings bring healing to the family, and particularly to Ariadne, who must face her selfishness and pride. Afshar again shows her amazing talent for packing action and intrigue into the biblical setting for modern readers. (Publishers Weekly)<br><br>Fearless. Bold. A survivor. This is Ariadne. After escaping her mother&#x2019;s cruelty in Athens, Ariadne returns to the exciting but corrupt city of Corinth only to discover her estranged father&#x2019;s dark secret: he is the Honorable Thief of Corinth. Hungry for revenge after years of abuse, Ariadne joins her father&#x2019;s thieving after a catastrophe at sea leaves the family in financial ruin. When a missionary named Paul arrives, Ariadne resists his message of love and grace. But without the lessons of Paul&#x2019;s Unknown God, her lust for vengeance could cost Ariadne her innocence, her reputation, or even her life. Afshar brings to life the gripping tale of one woman&#x2019;s struggle to choose between rebellion and love. This work of biblical fiction does not require biblical knowledge and offers superb momentum, exhilarating scenes, and moving themes of love and determination. Afshar&#x2019;s lyrical approach to Ariadne&#x2019;s voice makes for a relatable protagonist wrestling with timeless questions of worth and belonging in this exquisitely realistic portrait of the early missionary Paul. (Booklist)<br><br>Set in first-century Corinth, this latest novel from Christy Award winner Afshar (<i>Bread of Angels</i>) is another beautifully written tale based on the New Testament. Ariadne, tired of living in her mother&#x2019;s house after her parents&#x2019; divorce, flees to Corinth and her father&#x2019;s home. When she finds out that he makes his living as a thief, she begs to help him recoup the ill-gotten gains of the wealthy and corrupt. But their lives are endangered when the wrong person discovers their secret. Through rabbi Paul, they learn of a God who heals and forgives. Receiving grace and mercy for their sins and forgiveness is something they never thought could happen. <b>VERDICT:</b> Afshar&#x2019;s well-drawn characters and lushly detailed setting vividly bring to life the ancient world of the Bible. A solid choice for fans of Francine Rivers and Bodie and Brock Thoene.

A group of raw US Army Airmen travels to the embattled American Air Base of Port Moresby at Papua, New Guinea. Their mission: to protect Australia, to disrupt the Japanese supply lines, and to fly perilous reconnaissance runs over the enemy-held strongholds. Among the men are pilot Captain Jay Zeamer and bombardier Sergeant Raymond Joseph &#x201c;Joe&#x201d; Sarnoski, a pair of swashbuckling screw-ups whose antics prevent them from being assigned to a regular bombing crew. Instead, they rebuild a broken-down B-17 bomber from spare parts and christen the plane <i>Old 666</i>.<br> <br>One day in June 1943, a request is circulated: volunteers are needed for a reconnaissance flight into the heart of the Japanese empire. Zeamer and Sarnoski see it as a shot at redemption and cobble together a crew and depart in <i>Old 666</i> under cover of darkness. Five hours later, dozens of Japanese Zeros riddle the plane with bullets. Bloody and half-conscious, Zeamer and Sarnoski keep the plane in the air, winning what will go down as the longest dogfight in history and maneuvering an emergency landing in the jungle. Only one of them will make it home alive.<br> <br>With unprecedented access to the <i>Old 666</i> crew&#x2019;s family and letters, as well as newly released transcripts from the Imperial Air Force&#x2019;s official accounts of the battle, <i>Lucky 666</i> is perhaps the last untold &#x201c;great war story&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>) from the war in the Pacific.

Running him down from behind.<br> <br>Thirty minutes ago his belly gunner had counted over 20 on the Buka airstrip, close to a dozen kicking up dust as they taxied for takeoff. They would be on him soon; they should have been on him by now.<br> <br>&#x201c;Give me forty-five more seconds.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was Kendrick, over the interphone. The waist gunner and Photo Joe. Asking, begging, for just a little more time to get his pictures. The photographs, they&#x2019;d said back at the base, that could change the course of the war. Almost four hours in the air and this is what it had come to. Forty-five seconds.<br> <br>Below him the low sun caused the stunted eucalyptus trees to cast dappled shadows on the flowering frangipani of Japanese-held Bougainville Island. Far to the east the active volcano, Mount Bagana, spewed slender flutes of black smoke into the cloudless sky, like veins in blue granite. But it was neither the island&#x2019;s flora nor its topography that interested Captain Jay Zeamer and the anxious crew of his B-17 Flying Fortress this morning. It was the hidden reefs of Empress Augusta Bay. The reefs that lay submerged just beneath the breaking waves where the Marine landings would take place. The reefs waiting like bear traps to snag their LSTs.<br> <br>The reefs, the airfields, the enemy defenses: these were the reasons why Jay and his men were here. A lonely B-17 600 miles from home. Soon to face the might of the Japanese Imperial Navy&#x2019;s most elite fighter pilots, a desperate enemy determined to prevent the Americans from returning with their photos. The impossible mission, someone had called it. Now Jay Zeamer knew why.<br> <br>Not that every recon flight wasn&#x2019;t a deadly gamble. No fighter escort. Not even a friendly formation to help ward off the swarms of bogeys. Jay knew too many recon crews who had never returned. That was the rub. Scouting enemy positions was only half the job. Getting the information back would be the &#x201c;impossible&#x201d; part. The Zero pilots knew it as well.<br> <br>Jay scanned the bay again. Visibility was clear. Just a scrim of ground haze over the shore, which the infrared camera filters would cut through with ease.<br> <br>Now the tail gunner&#x2019;s voice crackling over the interphone. Another fighter squadron lifting off, this time from Bougainville. A dozen at least.<br> <br>Jay thought about cutting and running. No one would blame him. No one could. He had volunteered for this job with the clear understanding that he&#x2019;d run the operation his way. His way meant any way&#x2014;any way&#x2014;he wanted. They had already reconnoitered Buka Island. The flight wouldn&#x2019;t be a total waste. Hell, Buka was where the wolves behind him had picked up his scent.<br> <br>Why hadn&#x2019;t he trusted his gut, gone with his initial response? At first he&#x2019;d said no when they&#x2019;d tacked on the Buka run at the last minute. Just Bougainville, he&#x2019;d told them. Forget Buka; Buka was suicide. He should have held firm. What could they have done? Grounded him? He&#x2019;d been disciplined before, too many times to count. Washed out of one Bomb Group for being too flaky, nearly court-martialed by another for that stunt over Rabaul. A lot of people didn&#x2019;t like Jay. Aloof, they called him. A screwoff. No respect for authority.<br> <br>And this was where it had gotten him.<br> <br>When they wouldn&#x2019;t give him a plane he&#x2019;d foraged one, plucked from the boneyard at the rump end of the runway, and rebuilt it from the wheels up. When they wouldn&#x2019;t give him a crew he&#x2019;d recruited one, men like himself; misfits they called them at first, but each now an Airman with whom he&#x2019;d entrust his life. And when they wouldn&#x2019;t give him assignments he&#x2019;d volunteered for them, recon missions no one else wanted, missions they all had to be a little crazy to take on. Missions like this one, which right now his every good sense was screaming at him to abort.<br> <br>But then Jay envisioned the Marines. It was the middle of June 1943, and the war in the Pacific hung by a thread. In the 18 months since Pearl Harbor the Japanese had controlled the game, spreading like algae across the vast, watery theater, securing far-flung bases with impunity. Yet now the tide just might be turning. First at Midway, then on Guadalcanal. Small steps. But steps. And the island below him&#x2014;Bougainville&#x2014;was next. The key to unlocking the stranglehold of the Empire of the Rising Sun.<br> <br>After Bougainville there would be New Guinea, and from New Guinea a return to the Philippines, until finally the ships of the U.S. Navy would be lapping at Japanese shores. Forget the great and grand strategies transmitted from Washington, pushpins on a map. The turnaround in this war would begin with boots on the ground at Bougainville. Marines depending on his photos in order to reach that beachhead. If he didn&#x2019;t do the job, if he throttled and fled, someone else would have to come back and do it all over again. He could not live with that.<br> <br>Then another thought, creeping into his mind on cat&#x2019;s paws. A man&#x2019;s character is his fate. He hadn&#x2019;t been much for philosophy back at M.I.T. He was an engineer, a maker, a builder, with little use for pious pronouncements. But he never forgot that line. A man&#x2019;s character is his fate. One of the Greeks. Heraclitus? He considered himself a man of character, a pilot of character. He was the captain of a United States Army Air Force bomber crew, a leader of men. Well, he&#x2019;d soon find out his fate. Their fate.<br> <br>The first wave of Zeros hit them from the front. Through his port window he caught the bright yellow strobes of the twin 7.7-millimeter machine guns winking from the Zeke&#x2019;s nose. Then the larger red flare from one of its two 20-millimeter cannons flashed from the wing. The sound of the shells like shotgun blasts fired into a bucket of sand as they smashed into his plane.<br> <br>They were going for the bomber&#x2019;s front bubble, blasting it with cannon fire. But the bombardier Joe Sarnoski down in the Greenhouse was giving as good as he got, the red tracers from his twin .50-cals cutting bright curving arcs through the azure sky. Joe nailed the lead Zero, sending it into a spin, and now the entire crew opened up, even Kendrick at the waist windows, finished with his photos. Seventeen machine guns streaking the sky with evanescent streams of gray-black smoke. The old Fortress juddered and wheezed from their recoil.<br> <br>The rumble reached the cockpit first from the nose and then converged on him from behind, up from the belly gun and down from the top turret. Finally it growled through the fuselage from the tail gunner&#x2019;s blister all the way to the flight deck. It was the kind of noise you never forget, accompanied by the familiar odor, the smell of the fight, the grease and powder.<br> <br>From the corner of his eye he saw Joe Sarnoski blast a second bogey, raking the Zeke from the engine cowling to the wing tanks, the enemy fighter&#x2019;s aviation fuel erupting into orange flames that streaked to its tail. It was as if the bombardier were plowing a highway. The irony was not lost on Jay&#x2014;Joe was his best friend and had insisted on coming along on this one last mission before cashing his golden ticket back to the States, his kit already packed back in his quarters.<br> <br>Jay silently thanked God that he had just as another Zero hove into view in front of him. He pressed the trigger button on his wheel that fired the special nose gun he&#x2019;d installed just for this purpose. The bullets punctured the Zeke&#x2019;s fuselage, and he watched the aircraft flame out, making certain that it spiraled into the Solomon Sea.<br> <br>He was still craning his neck when the flash erupted in the cockpit. There was the briefest effusion of colors.<br> <br>And then everything went dark.</p><h2>Codename: Sailor V, Vol. 2</h2><p>Its Valentine&#x2019;s Day and chocolates are being exchanged, but Minako Aino can&#x2019;t decide if she wants a crush to give her chocolates to, or just to eat them all herself.

These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David MacKay&#39;s groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way. In sum, this is a textbook on information, communication, and coding for a new generation of students, and an unparalleled entry point into these subjects for professionals in areas as diverse as computational biology, financial engineering, and machine learning.</p><p>"...a valuable reference...enjoyable and highly useful." <br>American Scientist<br>"...an impressive book, intended as a class text on the subject of the title but having the character and robustness of a focused encyclopedia.

Author and naturalist Jack Ewing shares a wealth of observations and experiences, gathered from more than three decades of living in southwestern Costa Rica, home to some of the most prolific and diverse ecosystems on Earth. More than just a simple collection of essays, Monkeys are Made of Chocolate is a testament to the wonder of life in all its countless guises, as seen through the eyes of a man with a gift for subtle discernment and a natural flair for storytelling.</p><p>Jack Ewing&#x2019;s love affair with the rainforest began in 1970 when, in search of new opportunities for plying his Bachelor of Science degree and his skills as a cattle rancher, he left his native Colorado and moved his wife, Diane, and their young family to the jungles of Costa Rica. His ever-growing fascination with the rainforest, however, soon prompted his transformation into environmentalist and naturalist. <p>A natural-born storyteller, Jack&#x2019;s articles about life in the rainforest appear regularly in Costa Rican publications, and he often speaks to environmental, student and ecological traveler groups from around the world. He is currently president of two environmental organizations, ASANA and FUNDANTA.

Jack Valentine seemed to have it all. He made good money as an adman, and looked good doing it. He had a hot apartment, cool friends, even a slick car&#x2014;at least until the hectic Monday morning a truck smashed into it, sending the critically injured Jack to the hospital. Everything happens for a reason, though, and Jack&#x2019;s reason reveals itself in the silver-haired cancer patient who becomes his roommate one evening. The elderly man, Cal, shares his life story&#x2014;one not dissimilar to Jack&#x2019;s&#x2014;of material wealth masking a gaping hole within. Cal ultimately found salvation through philosophy ("the love of wisdom"), and now offers to help Jack by prepping the younger man for the Final Questions we all must face: Have I lived wisely? Have I loved well? Have I served greatly? Presenting Jack with three plane tickets, each accompanied by a map marked with a red X, Cal sends Jack to meet with three great teachers, each of whom will help Jack answer one of the Final Questions&#x2014;just as they once helped Cal. First, in Rome, Jack will meet "the Saint." Then a haunted beach in Hawaii introduces him to "the Surfer." And finally the grandeur of New York City sets the stage for his last encounter: with "the CEO." Along the way, Jack will learn to do his interior work, discover that our negative traits offer gateways to higher versions of ourselves, and understand that figuring things out in your head can distract you from the powerful whispers of your heart. Join Jack on his journey and step into the you that you were always meant to be.</p><p>Robin Sharma is one of the world&#x2019;s premier thinkers on leadership, personal growth and life management.

He's chronically unhappy, unfulfilled and broke; his girlfriend has left him; and he's just been hit by a truck. Still, when he wakes up in a hospital covered in bruises, he's certain it's all happening for a reason. As Jack recovers, his dying hospital roommate, who happens to be Jack's long-lost father, imparts some final advice: the only three questions that matter are whether one has lived wisely, loved well and served greatly. He sends Jack on a journey around the world to meet three teachers (the saint, surfer and CEO), who guide him through a spiritual transformation and help him answer the three questions. Sharma, a motivational speaker and "life coach," has attempted a spiritual allegory ... la Paulo Coelho's classic, The Alchemist. Unfortunately, Sharma's book lacks any narrative drive, the characters are thinly rendered and the dialogue is almost comically wooden ("You're getting to be a pretty good surfer there Jack." "It's become a passion of mine Moe"). Readers seeking Sharma's brand of advice (e.g., "see your life as a fantastic growth school" and "be true to yourself") will lose nothing simply turning to the last page, where the book's lessons are laid out in 10 succinct bullet points. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>CHASING DAYLIGHT</h2><p><p><strong>Choices unlock divine moments.

You may stumble, but you will find yourself falling forward, propelled toward the God-inspired adventure He intends you to live. Using the biblical characters of Saul and Jonathan during Israel's war with the Philistines (1 Samuel 13 and 14), Chasing Daylight (formerly titled Seizing Your Divine Moment) demonstrates the difference between living a life of purpose and adventure and living one of apathy and missed opportunity. While Saul rested beneath a pomegranate tree, Jonathan seized the divine moment and redirected the future of Israel. McManus uses Jonathan's example to artfully illustrates the eight characteristics of an adventurer's heart, what he calls "the Jonathan factor" </p><ul><li>Taking initiative</li><li>Accepting uncertainty</li><li>Stewarding influence</li><li>Embracing risk</li><li>Continuing to advance</li><li>Creating impact</li><li>Moving in obedience</li><li>Awakening potential</li></ul><p>We have but one life. We are given one opportunity to pursue our dreams and fulfill our divine purpose. Every moment counts, and we must engage them with fierceness and zeal.

Or with his title, his position, and all that goes with it?</p><p>One inescapable part of life at Broughton Hall is Charles's mother, the shrewd Lady Uckfield, known to her friends as "Googie" and described by the narrator---an actor who moves comfortably among the upper classes while chronicling their foibles---"as the most socially expert individual I have ever known at all well. She combined a watchmaker's eye for detail with a madam's knowledge of the world." Lady Uckfield is convinced that Edith is more interested in becoming a countess than in being a good wife to her son. And when a television company, complete with a gorgeous leading man, descends on Broughton Hall to film a period drama, "Googie's" worst fears seem fully justified.</p><p>In <i>Snobs</i>, a wickedly astute portrait of the intersecting worlds of aristocrats and actors, Julian Fellowes establishes himself as an irresistible storyteller and a deliciously witty chronicler of modern manners.</p></p><p><p><b>Julian Fellowes</b> is the Emmy Award-winning writer and creator of <i>Downton Abbey </i>and the winner of the 2001 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for <i>Gosford Park. </i>He also wrote the screenplays for <i>Vanity Fair </i>and <i>The Young Victoria.</i>He is the bestselling author of <i>Snobs </i>and <i>Past Imperfect. </i>His other works include <i>The Curious Adventure of the Abandoned Toys </i>and the book for the Disney stage musical of <i>Mary Poppins. </i></p><p>As an actor, his roles include Lord Kilwillie in the BBC Television series <i>Monarch of Glen</i> and the 2nd Duke of Richmond in <i>Aristocrats,</i> as well as appearances in the films <i>Shadowlands,</i> <i>Damage,</i>and <i>Tomorrow Never Dies.</i> </p><p>He lives in London and Dorset, England.</p>SNOBS (Chapter One)<p>I do not know exactly how Edith Lavery came first to be taken up by Isabel Easton. Probably they had a friend in common or sat on some committee together, or perhaps they just went to the same hairdresser. But I can remember that from quite early on, for some reason, Isabel decided that Edith was rather a feather in her cap, someone that little bit special to be fed to her country neighbours in rationed morsels. History was of course to prove her right, although there was no tremendously compelling evidence for this when I first met her. Edith was certainly very pretty then but not as she would be later when she had, as designers say, found her style. She was a type, albeit a superior example of it: the English blonde with large eyes and nice manners.</p><p>I had known Isabel Easton since we were children together in Hampshire and we enjoyed one of those pleasant, undemanding friendships that are based entirely on longevity. We had very little in common but we knew few other people who could remember us on our ponies at the age of nine and there was a certain comfort in our occasional encounters. I had gone into the theatre after leaving university and Isabel had married a stockbroker and moved to Sussex so our worlds scarcely crossed, but it was fun for Isabel to have an actor to stay occasionally who had been seen on television (though never, as it happens, by any of her friends) and for me, it was pleasant enough to spend the odd weekend with my old playmate.</p><p>I was in Sussex the first time that Edith came down and I can testify to Isabel's enthusiasm for her new friend, later queried by her less generous acquaintance. It was quite genuine: 'Things are going to happen for her. She's got something.' Isabel was fond of using phrases that seemed to imply an inside knowledge of the workings of the world. Some might have said that when Edith climbed out of the car half an hour later, she didn't appear to have got very much beyond her appearance and a rather beguiling, relaxed charm, but I was inclined to agree with our hostess. Looking back, there was a hint of what was to come in the mouth, one of those cut-glass mouths, with the clearly defined, almost chiselled lips that one associates with the film actresses of the forties. And then there was her skin. To the English, skin is, as a rule, the compliment of last resort, to be employed when there is nothing else to praise. Good skin is frequently dwelt on when talking of the plainer members of the Royal Family. Be that as it may, Edith Lavery had the loveliest complexion I have ever seen: cool, clear, pastel colours under layers of flawless wax. I have all my life had a weakness for good-looking people and in retrospect, I think I became Edith's ally in that first moment of admiring her face. At all events, Isabel was destined to become a self-fulfilling prophet for it was she who took Edith to Broughton.</p><p>Broughton Hall, indeed the very House of Broughton, was a wounding seam that marbled every aspect of the Eastons' Sussex life. As first Barons and then Earls Broughton and lately, since 1879, Marquesses of Uckfield, the Broughtons had held mighty sway over this particular section of East Sussex for a great deal longer than most potentates of the Home Counties. Until little more than a century ago their neighbours and vassals had mainly consisted of lowly farmers eking a living out of the flat and boggy marshland at the base of the downs but the roads and the railways and the invention of the Saturday-to-Monday had brought the <i>haute bourgeoisie</i> flooding to the area in search of <i>ton,</i> and, like Byron, the Broughtons awoke to find themselves famous. Before long, the local mark of whether one was 'in' or 'out' was largely based on whether or not one was on their visiting list. In fairness I must say that the family did not seek its celebrity, not at first anyway, but as the major representatives of the <i>anciens riches</i> in an upwardly mobile area their power was forced upon them.</p><p>They had been lucky in other ways. Two marriages, one to a banker's daughter and the other to the heiress of a large section of San Francisco had steered the family craft through the turbulent seas of the agricultural depression and the Great War. Unlike many such dynasties, they had retained some if not all of their London holdings, and various tricks with property in the sixties had brought them to the comparatively safe shores of Mrs Thatcher's Britain. After that, when the socialists did start to regroup they turned out, happily for the upper classes generally, to have been reborn as <i>New</i> Labour and so would prove much more accommodating than their rapacious political forebears. All in all, the Broughtons were the very acme of the 'surviving' English family. They had reached the 1990s with their prestige and, more significantly, their estates practically intact.</p><p>Not that any of this was a problem for the Eastons. Far from resenting the family's privileges they positively worshipped them. No, the difficulty was that despite living two miles from Broughton Hall itself, despite Isabel's telling her girlfriends over lunch in Walton Street what luck it was having the house 'practically next door', still, after three and a half years, they had never set foot in it, nor succeeded in meeting one single member of the family.</p><p>Of course, David Easton was not the first upper-middle-class Englishman to discover that it is easier to demonstrate a spurious aristocratic background in London than in the country. The problem was that after years of lunches at Brooks's, Saturdays at race-meetings and evenings at Annabel's, mouthing his prejudices against the modern, <i>mobile</i> society, he had entirely lost touch with the fact that he was a product of it. It was as if he had forgotten his father had been the managing director of a minor furniture factory in the Midlands and it was with some difficulty that his parents had put him through Ardingly. By the time I met him I think he would have been genuinely surprised not to have found his name in Debrett's. I remember once reading an article in which Roddy Llewellyn was quoted as complaining that he had not been to Eton (as his elder brother had) because it was at Eton that one picked up one's lifelong friends. David happened to be passing my chair. 'Quite right,' he said. 'That's exactly how I feel.' I looked across the room to catch Isabel's eye but I saw at once in her sympathetic nod that she did not want to be in my conspiracy but rather in her husband's.</p><p>To an outsider it seems a vital ingredient of many marriages that each partner should support the illusions of the other. Protected, as he had been, by a combination of Isabel's kindness and most London hostesses' indifference to anything beyond their guests' ability to talk and eat the food, it was now bitter indeed to sit at smart dinner tables and be asked about Charles Broughton's trip to Italy or how Caroline's new husband was shaping up and to have to murmur that he didn't really know them. 'But how extraordinary,' would come the answer. 'I thought you were neighbours.' And even in this admission there was a certain dishonesty, for it was not that David did not <i>really</i> know them. He did not know them at all.</p><p>Once at a cocktail party in Eaton Square he had ventured an opinion about the family only to hear his companion ask, 'But isn't that Charles over there? You must introduce me and we'll see if he remembers where we met.' And David had had to say he felt sick (which was more or less true) and go home and miss the dinner they had all been going on to. Lately he had taken to assuming a slightly dismissive air when they were mentioned. He would stand, loudly silent, on the edge of the discussion as if he, David Easton, preferred <i>not</i> to know the Broughtons. As if he had tried them and discovered they were not quite to his taste. Nothing could have been further from the truth. In fairness to David I would say that these frustrated social ambitions were probably as secret from his conscious mind as they were supposed to be from the rest of us. Or so it seemed to me as I watched him zip up his Barbour and whistle for the dogs.</p><p>Fittingly perhaps, it was Edith who suggested the visit. Isabel asked us at breakfast on Saturday if there was anything we'd like to do and Edith wondered whether there was a local 'stately' and what about that? She looked across at me.</p><p>'I wouldn't mind,' I said.</p><p>I saw Isabel glance at David deep in his <i>Telegraph</i> at the other end of the table. I knew and understood the Broughton situation and Isabel knew I knew, though, being English, we had naturally never discussed it. As it happens, I had met Charles Broughton, the rather lumpish son and heir, a couple of times in London at those hybrid evenings where Show Business and Society congregate but, like the crossing of two rivers, seldom mingle. These encounters I had kept from Isabel for fear of salting the wound.</p><p>'David?' she said.</p><p>He turned the pages of his newspaper with a large and insouciant gesture.</p><p>'You go if you want to. I've got to drive into Lewes. Sutton's lost the petrol cap of the lawn-mower again. He must eat them.'</p><p>'I could do that on Monday.'</p><p>'No, no. I want to get some cartridges anyway.' He looked up. 'Honestly, you go.'</p><p>There was reproach in his eyes, which Isabel dealt with by pulling a slight face as if her hand was being forced. The truth was they had an unspoken agreement not to visit the house as 'members of the public'. At first David had avoided it because he had expected to know the family quite soon and he did not want to run the risk of meeting them from the wrong side of the cordon. As the months and then years of disappointment had unfolded, not visiting the house had become a kind of principle, as if he did not want to give the Broughtons the satisfaction of seeing him pay good money to see what should, by rights, have been his for nothing. But Isabel was more pragmatic than her husband, as women generally are, and she had grown accustomed to the idea that their position in the 'County' was going to be deferred for a while. Now she was simply curious to see the place that had become a symbol of their lack of social muscle. She did not therefore require much persuading. The three of us packed into her battered Renault and set off.</p><p>I asked Edith if she knew Sussex at all.</p><p>'Not really. I had a friend in Chichester for a while.'</p><p>'The fashionable end.'</p><p>'Is it? I didn't know counties had fashionable ends. It sounds rather American. Like good and bad tables in the same restaurant.'</p><p>'Do you know America?'</p><p>'I spent a few months in Los Angeles after I left school.'</p><p>'Why?'</p><p>Edith laughed. 'Why not? Why does one go anywhere at seventeen?'</p><p>'I don't know why one goes to Los Angeles. Unless it's to become a film star.'</p><p>'Maybe I wanted to be a film star.' She smiled at me with what I have since come to recognise as a habitual expression of slight sadness, and I saw that her <i>eyes</i> were not blue as I had at first thought, but a sort of misty grey.</p><p>We turned through a pair of monumental stone piers, topped with lead stags' heads, antlers and all, and started down the wide gravel drive. Isabel stopped the car. 'Isn't it marvellous!' she said. The vast mass of Broughton Hall sprawled before us. Edith smiled enthusiastically and we drove on. She did not think the house marvellous, no more did I, although it was in its way impressive. At any rate, it was very large. It seemed to have been designed by an eighteenth-century forerunner of Albert Speer. The main block, a huge granite cube, was connected to two smaller cubes with stocky and cumbersome colonnades. Unfortunately a nineteenth-century Broughton had stripped the windows of their mullions and replaced them with plate glass so now they gaped, vacant and sightless, across the park. At the four corners of the house squat cupolas had been erected like watch-towers in a concentration camp. All in all, it did not so much complete the view as block it.</p><p>The car crunched comfortably to a halt. 'Shall we do the house first or the garden?' Isabel, like a 1960s Soviet military inspector in the heart of NATO, was determined to miss nothing.</p><p>Edith shrugged. 'Is there a lot to see inside?'</p><p>'Oh, I think so,' said Isabel firmly, striding towards the door marked 'Enter'. It crouched in the embrace of the ponderous horseshoe flight of steps leading up to the <i>piano nobile.</i> The rusticated granite swallowed her and we meekly followed.</p><p>One of Edith's favourite stories would always be that she first saw Broughton as a paying guest, barred by a red rope from the intimate life of the house. 'Not,' as she would remark with her funny half-laugh, 'that the place has ever had much intimate life.' There are houses with such a sense of the personalities that built them, an all-pervading smell of the lives lived there, that the visitor feels himself a cross between a burglar and a ghost, spying on a private place with hidden secrets. Broughton was not such a house. It had been designed down to the last fender and finial with one single aim: to impress strangers. Consequently its role at the end of the twentieth century had hardly changed at all. The only difference being that now the strangers bought tickets instead of tipping the housekeeper.</p><p>For the modern visitor, however, the splendours of the state rooms were deferred, and the cold, dank room by which we entered (later we would know it as the Under Hall) was as welcoming as a deserted stadium. Hard-looking footmen's chairs stood around the walls, conjuring up a vision of endless hours of boredom spent sitting on them, and a long, black table filled the centre of the discoloured stone floor. Apart from four dirty views of Venice, a long way after Canaletto, there were no pictures. Like all the rooms at Broughton, the hall was perfectly enormous, making the three of us feel like the Borrowers.</p><p>'Well, they don't believe in the soft sell,' said Edith.</p><p>From the Under Hall, clutching our guide-books, we climbed the Great Staircase with its carved oak flights clambering up around a burly and rather depressing bronze of a dying slave. At the top, after crossing the wide landing, we came first to the Marble Hall, a vast, double-storeyed space with a balustraded gallery round all four sides at second-floor level. Had we entered by the exterior horseshoe stair this would have been our (intentionally flattening) introduction to the house. From this we progressed to the Saloon, another huge room, this time with heavy mahogany mouldings picked out in gold and walls hung with crimson flock wallpaper.</p><p>'Chicken tikka for me,' said Edith.</p><p>I laughed. She was quite right. It looked exactly like a gigantic Indian restaurant.</p><p>Isabel opened the guide-book and began to read in a geography-mistress voice: 'The Saloon is hung with its original paper, one of the chief glories of Broughton's interior. The gilt side-tables were made for this room by William Kent in seventeen-thirty-nine. The maritime theme of the carved pier glasses was inspired by the appointment of the third earl to the embassy in Portugal in seventeen thirty-seven. The Earl, himself, is commemorated in this, his favourite room in the full-length portrait by Jarvis, which hangs, together with its companion of his countess by Hudson, on either side of the Italian fireplace.'</p><p>Edith and I stared at the pictures. The one of Lady Broughton made a little stab at gaiety by posing the heavy-featured young woman on a bank of flowers, a summer hat trailing from her large hand.</p><p>'There's a woman at my gym exactly like that,' said Edith. 'She's always trying to sell me Conservativ...</p></p><h2>Qualities of Effective Teachers</h2><p><p>Every teacher seeks to be an <em>effective</em> teacher.

The first poem sets the tone, encouraging readers to breathe in and out for "My breath/is a river of peace." While the poems are independent of each other, their stark beauty and personification of nature unify the work. Each powerful emotion conveyed through figurative language, whether it is anxiety, doubt, fear, or anger, is reinforced with expressive watercolors. When Coombs offers advice for "Thoughts [that] flutter and dart like birds," the illustration reveals a young girl's troubled backward glance at her kite stuck in a tree that is overwhelmed by brightly hued birds. It is a staggering image, to see thoughts made manifest in such numbers, but the scene provides a sense of serenity as the girl leaves her footprints behind in the snow. It is recognizing the words "There is time to breathe and be" within the poem as well as the stillness in the illustration that helps to release the tension inherent in the birds and thoughts. The harmony between children and their environment, along with the inclusion of minute details in the artwork, instills a sense of wonder as each panel challenges readers to dwell in the moment. It is the same message conveyed in the poetry. An author's note explains mindfulness as a concept and provides a definition of the tanka form.

In other words, this is a book that only a small, alternative press could publish, a book secretly praised by large publishing house editors who would have to pass by ADIOS to publish non-offensive, committee-voiced textbooks, reference trade books by establishment columnists, or feel-good, ego-salve books.

The Pulitzer Prize for Drama</b><p>When her father dies unexpectedly, graphic novelist Alison dives deep into her past to tell the story of the volatile, brilliant, one-of-a-kind man whose temperament and secrets defined her family and her life. Moving between past and present, Alison relives her unique childhood playing at the family's Bechdel Funeral Home, her growing understanding of her own sexuality, and the looming, unanswerable questions about her father's hidden desires. <i>Fun Home</i> is a refreshingly honest, wholly original musical about seeing your parents through grown-up eyes.</p></p><p>ALISON BECHDEL has been a careful archivist of her own life and kept a<br>journal since she was ten. Since 1983 she has been chronicling the lives of<br>various characters in the fictionalized "Dykes to Watch Out For" strip, "one<br>of the preeminent oeuvres in the comics genre, period" (Ms.). The<br>strip is syndicated in 50 alternative newspapers, translated into multiple<br>languages, and collected into a book series with a quarter of a million<br>copies in print. Utne magazine has listed DTWOF as "one of the greatest<br>hits of the twentieth century."*Starred Review* This is a father and daughter story. Bechdel's mother and two brothers are in it, of course, but Bruce Bechdel had the biggest impact on his eldest child and so is naturally the other main character in her autobiographical graphic novel. Emotionally and physically reserved, to the point of brusqueness, he busied himself restoring--and then some--the Victorian-era house he bought for the family in the Pennsylvania town in which he was born and lived virtually all his 44 years. He enlisted the kids for never-ending interior and exterior modifications of the place in what obviously was his major creative outlet. For a living, he taught twelfth-grade English and ran the small undertaking business that occupied part of his parents' house and that the kids called the fun home. Bechdel doesn't even hint about how ironic she and her brothers meant to be, because she is a narrative artist, not a moralist or comedian, in this book and because she has a greater, real-life irony to consider. After disclosing her lesbianism in a letter home from college, her mother replied that her father was homosexual, too. Alison suddenly understood his legal trouble over buying a beer for a teenage boy, all the teen male "helpers" he had around the house, and his solo outings during family vacations to New York. Bechdel's long-running <i>Dykes to Watch Out For</i> is arguably the best comic strip going, and <i>Fun Home</i> is one of the very best graphic novels ever. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He is determined, though, to show his mother that he can find them. With the help of his red scarf&#x2014;and a few animals along the way&#x2014;Earl embarks on an all-night search. But will he ever be able to locate an acorn?</p><p>Don Freeman was born in San Diego, California, in 1908. At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br><br>Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for The New York Times and The Herald Tribune. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br><br>He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br><br>Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br><br>Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including Corduroy, A Pocket for Corduroy, and the Caldecott Honor Book Fly High, Fly Low.Warm and welcoming as she opens the story, J.J. Myers draws the listener into Freeman&#39;s fanciful world of gray squirrels. Who would think that a squirrel might lack confidence in finding acorns, that a sympathetic human might offer solutions, or that a squirrel-chasing bull would provide the most help? Myers is unobtrusive as narrator, indignant as Mother Squirrel, gruff and mysterious as Owl, and reticent turning to confident as Earl. Myers&#39;s brisk pace keeps Earl&#39;s quest moving, and her inflection heightens suspense. Young listeners will take pleasure in Freeman&#39;s story of finding oneself and enjoy his energetic illustrations.

The answer is not obvious, despite the fact that we are often personally stuck dealing with people for whom there is no better name. Try as we might to avoid them, assholes are found everywhere and in multiple iterations: smug assholes, royal assholes, the presidential asshole, corporate assholes, reckless assholes. The list goes on. <br><br> Asshole management begins with asshole understanding. Much as Machiavelli illuminated political strategy for princes, this book finally gives us the concepts to think or say why assholes disturb us so, and explains why such people seem part of the human social condition, especially in an age of raging narcissism and unbridled capitalism. These concepts are also practically useful, as understanding the asshole we are stuck with helps us think constructively about how to handle problems he (and they are mostly all men) presents. We get a better sense of when the asshole is best resisted, and when he is best ignored&#x2014;a better sense of what is, and what is not, worth fighting for.</p><p>Aaron James holds a PhD from Harvard and is Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Irvine. He is the author of <i>Fairness</i> <i>in Practice: A Social Contract for a Global Economy</i>, and was awarded the Burkhardt Fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies, spending the 2009-10 academic year at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University. He&#x2019;s an avid surfer (the experience of which has directly inspired this book) . . . and he&#x2019;s not an asshole.[ 1 ] a theory<br><br>�In the summer of 2010, Stanley McChrystal, U.S. army general and Afghan war commander, reportedly trashed the U.S. civilian military leadership, in effect forcing President Barack Obama to ask him to resign. The display of disrespect was striking, but more telling were the details about McChrystal&#x2019;s handling of smaller matters. According to one story, McChrystal was once apprised by his chief of staff that he was obliged to attend a dinner in Paris with NATO allies&#x2014;�if not to shore up flagging support for the war, then simply because, as the chief of staff put it, &#x201c;the dinner comes with the position, sir.&#x201d; McChrystal held up his middle finger, retorting, &#x201c;Does this come with the position?&#x201d;<br><br>For brazen disregard, General McChrystal pales in comparison to another general, Douglas MacArthur. During the Korean War, MacArthur was a law unto himself, in matters both big and small. He quarreled defiantly in public with President Truman, agitating for nuclear war. In their eventual confrontation at Wake Island, MacArthur went so far as to arrive first and then order the president&#x2019;s approaching plane into a holding pattern. MacArthur&#x2019;s commander in chief would thus arrive on the landing strip appearing to be MacArthur&#x2019;s supplicant.<br><br>In explaining why he subsequently relieved MacArthur of his command, Truman said, &#x201c;I fired him because he wouldn&#x2019;t respect the authority of the president. I didn&#x2019;t fire him because he was a dumb son of a bitch, although he was, but that&#x2019;s not against the law for generals.&#x201d; Truman was arguably pulling his punches. He could easily have called MacArthur an asshole.<br><br>That would not be an exotic charge: assholes abound in history and public life. Aside from runaway generals, we might think of such contemporary figures as former Italian president Silvio Berlusconi, Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, or Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. We might think of the self-�important developer-�entertainer Donald Trump, the harsh pop music critic Simon Cowell, or the narcissist actor Mel Gibson. Assholes are found daily on cable news, where hosts repeatedly interrupt their guests, and also on talk radio, where airtime is given to commentators who thrive on falsehood and invective. Even as this demonstrably degrades the public debate so vital for a healthy democratic society, overheated commentators get rich and famous, while clearly having a really great time.<br><br>All of this poses a larger philosophical question: What is it for someone to be an asshole? The answer is not obvious, despite the fact that we are often personally stuck dealing with people for whom there is no better name. Assholes can be found not simply in history and high public office but almost anywhere&#x2014;�at work; in our chosen club; sport; school; religious group; circle of friends; and even, for the truly unlucky, in the home or immediate family. Try as we might to avoid them, we often simply have to manage encounters that come, for most of us, with great difficulty and personal strain. The asshole is not just another annoying person but a deeply bothersome person&#x2014;�bothersome enough to trigger feelings of powerlessness, fear, or rage. To make matters worse, we may be unable to understand why exactly someone should be so disturbing. We may feel certain only that &#x201c;asshole&#x201d; is a suitably unsavory name for this particular person.<br><br>While most of us could use advice in asshole management, we cannot get far without an answer to our initial question: What is it for someone to be an asshole? If nothing else, a good answer&#x2014;�a good theory of the asshole&#x2014;�would be intellectually interesting. It would give us the concepts to finally think or say why some people disturb us so. That, in turn, would ideally open a window into deeper aspects of morality and social life. We would see what assholes reveal about the human social condition and why assholes are everywhere, in every society. Ideally, a good theory would be practically useful. Understanding the asshole we are stuck with might help us think constructively about how best to handle him. We might get a better sense of when the asshole is best resisted and when he is best ignored&#x2014;�a better sense of what is, and what is not, worth fighting for.<br><br>According to our theory, which we will present shortly, the asshole exposes a deep feature of morality that philosophers have sought to understand from the time of Jean-�Jacques Rousseau to this day. The asshole refuses to listen to our legitimate complaints, and so he poses a challenge to the idea that we are each to be recognized as moral equals. This explains why the asshole is so bothersome, by revealing the great importance we attach to recognition in unexpected areas of our lives. In later chapters, we will suggest that a clearer understanding of this helps with asshole management. The key is to understand why we are easily tempted to fight on the asshole&#x2019;s terms: we are fighting for moral recognition in his eyes. We will also explore larger, more basic questions about human social life. Why are assholes mainly men? Can assholes be properly blamed? Why do some societies produce more assholes than others? Are certain styles of capitalism especially prone to asshole production and thus social decline? And, finally, can we ultimately make peace not only with the given asshole but also with a human social condition in which assholes flourish?<br><br>what is it to be an asshole?<br><br>Our theory is simply this: a person counts as an asshole when, and only when, he systematically allows himself to enjoy special advantages in interpersonal relations out of an entrenched sense of entitlement that immunizes him against the complaints of other people. (Because assholes are by and large men, we use the masculine pronoun &#x201c;he&#x201d; advisedly. We will suggest that women can be assholes as well. For the time being, think of Ann Coulter. We consider the question of gender in detail in chapter 4.) Our theory thus has three main parts. In interpersonal or cooperative relations, the asshole:<br><br>(1) allows himself to enjoy special advantages and does so systematically;<br><br>(2) does this out of an entrenched sense of entitlement; and<br><br>(3) is immunized by his sense of entitlement against the complaints of other people.<br><br>So, for example, the asshole is the person who habitually cuts in line. Or who frequently interrupts in a conversation. Or who weaves in and out of lanes in traffic. Or who persistently emphasizes another person&#x2019;s faults. Or who is extremely sensitive to perceived slights while being oblivious to his crassness with others. An insensitive person&#x2014;�a mere &#x201c;jerk&#x201d;&#x2014;�might allow himself to so enjoy &#x201c;special advantages&#x201d; in such interpersonal relations. What distinguishes the asshole is the way he acts, the reasons that motivate him to act in an abusive and arrogant way. The asshole acts out of a firm sense that he is special, that the normal rules of conduct do not apply to him. He may not deliberately exploit interpersonal relations but simply remain willfully oblivious to normal expectations. Because the asshole sets himself apart from others, he feels entirely comfortable flouting accepted social conventions, almost as a way of life. Most important, he lives this way more or less out in the open. He stands unmoved when people indignantly glare or complain. He is &#x201c;immunized&#x201d; against anyone who speaks up, being quite confident that he has little need to respond to questions about whether the advantages he allows himself are acceptable and fair. Indeed, he will often himself feel indignant when questions about his conduct are raised. That, from his point of view, may show that he is not getting the respect he deserves.<br><br>Although our theory is a definition of the term &#x201c;asshole,&#x201d; we should emphasize that it is not necessarily a dictionary definition. It is not necessarily a claim about how the word &#x201c;asshole&#x201d; is commonly used in some linguistic group (e.g., speakers of English). The word is often used loosely and variously, and we aren&#x2019;t suggesting that every competent speaker of English would agree with our proposal about what the word means. We aren&#x2019;t even saying that a majority of speakers would agree, in a way that might be confirmed or undermined by opinion polls or psychological experiments. Instead, our approach is the one Socrates explains to Polus in Plato&#x2019;s Gorgias, when he explains why the dispute between them does not depend on opinion polls (what they call &#x201c;the company&#x201d;). Polus asks, &#x201c;But do you not think, Socrates, that you have been sufficiently refuted, when you say that which no human being will allow? Ask the company.&#x201d; Socrates replies:<br><br>you must not ask me to count the suffrages of the company [. . . .] I shall produce one witness only of the truth of my words, and he is the person with whom I am arguing; his suffrage I know how to take; but with the many I have nothing to do, and do not even address myself to them. May I ask then whether you will answer in turn and have your words put to the proof?<br><br>Our definition, in other words, is a constructive proposal. It tries to articulate what we ordinarily mean when we speak of &#x201c;assholes&#x201d; but ultimately stands or falls on whether it captures the importance assholes have for us&#x2014;�where the &#x201c;us&#x201d; is, in the first instance, you and me. I am proposing the definition in light of importance that assholes have for us. You decide whether you agree.</p><h2>Critical Theory: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)</h2><p>Critical theory emerged in the 1920s from the work of the Frankfurt School, the circle of German-Jewish academics who sought to diagnose -- and, if at all possible, cure -- the ills of society, particularly fascism and capitalism. In this book, Stephen Eric Bronner provides sketches of leading representatives of the critical tradition (such as George Lukcs and Ernst Bloch, Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse and Jurgen Habermas) as well as many of its seminal texts and empirical investigations. <br><br>This <em>Very Short Introduction</em> sheds light on the cluster of concepts and themes that set critical theory apart from its more traditional philosophical competitors. Bronner explains and discusses concepts such as method and agency, alienation and reification, the culture industry and repressive tolerance, non-identity and utopia. He argues for the introduction of new categories and perspectives for illuminating the obstacles to progressive change and focusing upon hidden transformative possibilities. In this newly updated second edition, Bronner targets new academic interests, broadens his argument, and adapts it to a global society amid the resurgence of right-wing politics and neo-fascist movements.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stephen Eric Bronne</strong>r is Board of Governors Professor at Rutgers University.

First Volume of this scarce Automobile Guide from African Americans. <em>The Negro Motorist Green Book</em> was an annual guidebook for African American road trippers. It was originated and published by African American mailman Victor Hugo Green from 1936 to 1966, during the era of Jim Crow laws, when open and often legally prescribed discrimination against African Americans especially and other non-whites was widespread. Although pervasive racial discrimination and poverty limited black car ownership, the emerging African American middle class bought automobiles as soon as they could, though they faced a variety of dangers and inconveniences along the road, from refusal of food and lodging to arbitrary arrest. In response, Green wrote his guide to services and places relatively friendly to African Americans, eventually expanding its coverage from the New York area to much of North America, as well as founding a travel agency.</p><p>Many Black Americans took to driving, in part to avoid segregation on public transportation. As the writer George Schuyler put it in 1930, "all Negroes who can do so purchase an automobile as soon as possible in order to be free of discomfort, discrimination, segregation and insult." Black Americans employed as athletes, entertainers, and salesmen also traveled frequently for work purposes.</p><p>Shortly after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed the types of racial discrimination that had made the Green Book necessary, publication ceased, and it fell into obscurity. There has been a revived interest in it in the early 21st century in connection with studies of black travel during the Jim Crow era.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Science of Skinny</h2><p>With scientific research, her own chemistry background, and the traditional diets of our not-so-distant ancestors as her guide, Dee McCaffrey casts new light on an age-old wisdom: Eating foods in their closest-to-natural form is the true path to sustained weight loss and, in fact, the remedy for almost any health problem.

But at some point, kids will try to wrap their minds around the actual concept, and this ambitious picture book will help. Looking up at the endless stars, Uma feels 'very, very small' and begins to think about infinity. She asks around&#x2015;friends, Grandma, teachers&#x2015;and receives a formidable potpourri of interpretations and explanations. Uma is overwhelmed by the mental exercise, and her musings and worries are perfectly childlike ('Maybe I could lick an ice-cream cone forever, but what if my tongue started to hurt?'). Grandma brings Uma back to reality with a compliment on her new red shoes that she's been waiting for all day, and Uma lands on her own practical understanding of infinity ('my love for her was as big as infinity'). <strong>Even for adults, this is an enormously complex idea&#x2015;scientifically, mathematically, philosophically&#x2015;but Hosford smoothly distills it to a manageable serving that will both engage and challenge kids.

When friends, her grandmother, the school cook and the music teacher offer creative ways of describing infinity, Uma ends up feeling rather overwhelmed. She then realizes that her pondering has made her forget about the new red shoes she'd been so excited about right before her stargazing musings began. Worse yet&#x2015;no one had noticed her fancy new footwear that day! But after school, Grandma tells her 'Uma, I meant to tell you this morning&#x2015;those are the most beautiful shoes I have ever seen!' and in a joyous spread, Uma glories, '...my love for her was as big as infinity.' Then Uma and her grandmother go outside to look at the sky, and '[s]nuggled up to Grandma, the sky didn't seem so huge and cold anymore. Now it was more like a sparkly blanket, covering us both.' While Hosford's text deftly evokes the child's voice, Swiatkowska's expressive, lush illustrations steal the show, providing infinite opportunities for readers to examine each and every spread.</p><p><strong>A stellar artistic vision of the infinite power of intergenerational love</strong>." --starred, <em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p><br> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"<strong>This unusual, philosophical picture book makes this seemingly difficult concept approachable and interesting.</strong> Young Uma ponders the concept of infinity with the help of friends and family. She finds that the idea can be mind-boggling, but seems less scary when considered in loving company. The story effortlessly combines the enormity of the universe with the frankly personal, as represented by Uma's pride in her new red shoes. Characters define infinity with charming and age-appropriate examples, from a family tree that goes on forever to a never-ending ice-cream cone. A fascinating endnote lets youngsters hear the voices of real children explaining infinity and challenges readers to define it for themselves. Swiatkowska's whimsical, surreal, old-fashioned paintings are well suited to the subject matter. Her art also grace Ilene Cooper's The Golden Rule (Abrams, 2007), another thoughtful picture book, which would combine well with this one. <strong>This quiet jewel is sure to spark contemplation and conversation among readers.</strong>" &#x2015;<em>School Library Journal</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Dark-haired Uma sits wide-eyed in her backyard under a black, star-studded sky, torn between the charm of her new red shoes and the overwhelming size of the universe. 'How many stars were in the sky? A million? A billion? Maybe the number was as big as infinity.' Friends, teachers, and family give Uma new ways to think about infinity&#x2015;as an endless succession of ancestors, or as a noodle cut in half and in half again (Swiatkowska draws Uma cutting a python-sized noodle with a knife, demonstrating that things can become infinitely small, too). She struggles with the sheer enormity of the idea: 'Actually, my head was starting to hurt from all these thoughts.' It's not until Uma's grandmother notices her shoes that Uma can make infinity her own: '[M]y love for her was as big as infinity.' <strong>Hosford's (<em>Big Bouffant</em>) story is as much a look into the interior life of a sensitive girl as it is a meditation on a mathematical concept&#x2015;a task for which Swiatkowska's (<em>This Baby</em>) idiosyncratic portraits are perfectly suited</strong>." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>So innocuous-looking a symbol, that recumbent numeral eight. But for the little girl Uma, pondering the deep night sky (during a bout of sleeplessness brought on my the excitement of a new pair of red shoes), the concept of infinity is elusive, intimidating, and even a little bit scary. The next day she asks classmates, relatives, and acquaintances how they would express their understanding of infinity, and their range of answers, from sensible to poetic, provides the child--and readers of any age--a way to master the idea. For Grandma, infinity is a family extending limitless generations into the future. For Uma's friend Samantha, it's a racetrack you can drive around forever. For the school cook, it's endless divisibility: "In your mind...could you cut that tiny piece of noodle in half forever?" Uma's own attempt at imagining infinity begins with something she'd like to do forever--have recess--and ends with the vague worry that eternal recess might be a paradox: "If there's no school before recess, and no school after recess, is it really recess anymore?" Uma admits that these thoughts make her head hurt, and her pleasure at having Grandma notice and compliment her new red shoes brings her (and audiences') musings back down to stable, solid, comforting Earth. <strong>Swiatkowska's imaginative artwork combines the free-wheeling, slightly eerie absurdity of Monty Python animations, the formality of nineteenth-century decorative patterning, and the playful nerdiness of Leonardo da Vinci-styled inventions. For math and language arts teachers in search of circular common ground, &#x221e; marks the spot.</strong>"<em>&#x2015;The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"At a certain stage, children migrate onward to googolplex and infinity, concepts so unfathomable they practically pulsate with magic. Darkly illustrated with an undercurrent of almost existential angst, this smart book follows pensive 8-year-old Uma, who wonders, upon viewing the stars, 'How could I even think about something as big as infinity?' <strong>Swiatkowska's Victorian-style drawings are vaguely reminiscent of Edward Gorey, and Hosford effectively reflects the ways in which young children might grapple with, and come to some understanding of, such an impenetrable notion.</strong> Parents may still be adrift." --<em>The New York Times Book Review</em></p> (<i>Newspaper</i>)</p><h2>Lonely Planet Cruise Ports Alaska (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world&#x2019;s number one travel guide publisher*</i></p> <p><b>Lonely Planet&#x2019;s Cruise Ports Alaska</b> is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

He had no idea what to do with himself, because it seemed everything there was to be done had already been done or was being done by somebody else.<br>Moominpappa aimlessly puttered about in his garden, his tail dragging along the ground behind him in a melancholy way. Here, down in the Valley, the heat was scorching; everything was still and silent, and not a little dusty. It was the month when there could be great forest fires, the month for taking great care.<br>He had warned the family. Time and time again he had explained how necessary it was to be careful in August. He had described the burning valley, the roar of the flames, the white-hot tree trunks, and the fire creeping along the ground underneath the moss. Blinding columns of flame flung upward against the night sky! Waves of fire, rushing down the sides of the valley and on toward the sea ...<br>&#x201c;Sizzling, they throw themselves into the sea,&#x201d; finished Moominpappa with gloomy satisfaction. &#x201c; Everything is black; everything has been burned up. A tremendous responsibility rests on the smallest creature who can lay his paws on matches.&#x201d;<br>The family stopped what they were doing and said: &#x201c;Yes. Of course.

His paws got stuck in the varnish as usual, making little sucking sounds all the way up and across the floor, right up to the wicker chair. His tail got stuck, too; it felt as though someone were pulling it.<br>Moominpappa sat down and shut his eyes. &#x201c;That floor ought to be revarnished,&#x201d; he thought. &#x201c;The heat makes it like that, of course. But a good varnish shouldn&#x2019;t start melting just because it&#x2019;s hot. Perhaps I used the wrong sort of varnish. It&#x2019;s an awfully long time since I built the verandah, and it&#x2019;s high time it was revarnished. But first it&#x2019;ll have to be rubbed with sandpaper, a rotten job that no one will thank me for doing. But there&#x2019;s something special about a new white floor, painted with a thick brush and shiny varnish. The family will have to use the back door and keep out of the way while I&#x2019;m doing it. And then I&#x2019;ll let them come in, saying: &#x2018;There you are! Look, your new verandah!&#x2019; ... It&#x2019;s much too hot. I&#x2019;d love to be out sailing. Sailing right out to sea, as far as I can go ...&#x201d;<br>Moominpappa felt a sleepy feeling in his paws. He shook himself and lit his pipe. The match went on burning in the ashtray, and he watched it, fascinated. Just before it went out, he tore up some bits of newspaper and put them on the flame. It was a pretty little fire, hardly visible in the sunshine, but it was burning nicely. He watched it carefully.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s going out again,&#x201d; said Little My. &#x201c;Put some more on!&#x201d; She was sitting in the shade on the verandah railings.<br>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s you!&#x201d; said Moominpappa, and he shook the ashtray until the fire went out. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just watching the way fire burns. It&#x2019;s very important.&#x201d;<br>Little My laughed, and went on looking at him. Then he pulled his hat down over his eyes and took refuge in sleep.<br>&#x201c;Pappa,&#x201d; said Moomintroll. &#x201c;Wake up! We&#x2019;ve just put out a forest fire!&#x201d;<br>Both Moominpappa&#x2019;s paws were stuck firmly to the floor. He wrenched them loose with a strong feeling of reluctance. It wasn&#x2019;t fair. &#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;A real little forest fire,&#x201d; Moomintroll told him. &#x201c;Just behind the tobacco patch. The moss was on fire, and Mamma says that it might have been a spark from the chimney ...&#x201d;<br>Moominpappa leapt into the air and in a flash became a determined man of action. His hat rolled down the steps.<br>&#x201c;We put it out!&#x201d; Moomintroll shouted. &#x201c;We put it out right away. There&#x2019;s nothing for you to worry about!&#x201d;<br>Moominpappa stopped dead. He was feeling very angry. &#x201c;Have you put it out without me?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t anybody tell me? You just let me go on sleeping without saying anything!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But, dearest,&#x201d; said Moominmamma, leaning out of the kitchen window, &#x201c;we didn&#x2019;t think it was really necessary to wake you up. It was a very small fire, and it was only smoking a little. I happened to be going by with some buckets of water, so all I had to do was to sprinkle a few drops on it in passing ...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In passing,&#x201d; cried Moominpappa. &#x201c;Just sprinkle.<br>Sprinkle, indeed! What a word! And leaving the fire to burn under the moss unguarded! Where is it? Where is it?&#x201d;<br>Moominmamma left what she was doing and led the way to the tobacco patch. Moomintroll stayed on the verandah gazing after them. The black spot in the moss was a very small spot indeed.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t imagine,&#x201d; said Moominpappa at last, very slowly, &#x201c;that a spot like this isn&#x2019;t dangerous. Far from it. It can go on burning under the moss, you see. In the ground. Hours and perhaps even days may go by, and then suddenly, whoof! The fire breaks out somewhere quite different. Do you see what I mean?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, dearest,&#x201d; answered Moominmamma.<br>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;m going to stay here,&#x201d; Moominpappa went on, sulkily digging in the moss. &#x201c;I shall stand guard over it. I&#x2019;ll stay here all night if necessary.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do you really think ...&#x201d; Moominmamma began. Then she just said, &#x201c;Yes. That&#x2019;s very good of you. One never knows what will happen with moss.&#x201d;<br>Moominpappa sat all afternoon watching the little black spot, first pulling up the moss for quite a way round it. He wouldn&#x2019;t leave it to go indoors for his dinner. He really wanted the others to think he was offended.<br>&#x201c;Do you think he&#x2019;ll stay out there all night?&#x201d; asked Moomintroll.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s quite possible,&#x201d; said Moominmamma.<br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re sore, you&#x2019;re sore,&#x201d; observed Little My, peeling her potatoes with her teeth. &#x201c;You have to be angry sometimes. Every Little Creep has a right to be angry. But he&#x2019;s angry in the wrong way. He&#x2019;s not letting it out, just shutting it up inside him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My dear child,&#x201d; said Moominmamma, &#x201c;Pappa knows what he&#x2019;s doing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think he does,&#x201d; said Little My simply. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t know at all. Do you know?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not really,&#x201d; Moominmamma had to admit.<br>Moominpappa dug his nose in the moss and was aware of the sour smell of smoke. The ground wasn&#x2019;t even warm any longer. He emptied his pipe into the hole and blew on the sparks. They glowed for a moment or two and then went out. He stamped on the fatal spot and then walked slowly down the garden to have a look in his crystal ball.<br>Dusk was rising from the ground, as it usually did, gathering in under the trees. Round the crystal ball there was a little more light. There it stood, reflecting the whole garden, looking very beautiful on its coral pedestal. It was Moominpappa&#x2019;s very own crystal ball, his own magic ball of shining blue glass, the center of the garden, of the Valley, and of the whole world.<br>But Moominpappa didn&#x2019;t look into it right away. First he looked at his grimy paws, trying to collect all his vague, scattered, and troubled thoughts. When he was feeling as sad as he possibly could, he looked into the crystal ball for consolation. Every evening of that long, warm, beautiful, and melancholy summer he had done the same thing.<br>The crystal ball was always cool. Its blue was deeper and clearer than the blue of the sea itself, and it changed the color of the whole world, so that it became cool and remote and strange. At the center of this glass world he saw himself, his own big nose, and around him he saw the reflection of a transformed, dreamlike landscape. The blue ground was deep, deep down inside, and there where he couldn&#x2019;t reach, Moominpappa began to search for his family. He only had to wait a while and they always came. They were always reflected in the crystal ball.<br>It was only natural, because they had so much to do at dusk. They were always doing something. Sooner or later, Moominmamma would bustle over from the kitchen side of the house toward the outside cellar to fetch some sausages or some butter. Or to the potato patch. Or to get some wood. Every time she did it, she looked as though she were walking down a completely strange and exciting path. But you could never be sure. She might just as well be out on some secret errand of her own which she thought was fun, or playing some private game, or just walking round for the sake of it.<br>There she came, scampering along like a busy white ball, farthest away among the bluest of blue shadows. And there was Moomintroll, aloof and keeping himself to himself. And there was Little My, slinking up the slope more like a movement than anything else, you could see so little of her. She was just a glimpse of something determined and independent&#x2014;something so independent that it had no need to show itself. But their reflections made them all seem incredibly small, and the crystal ball made all their movements seem forlorn and aimless.<br>Moominpappa liked this. It was his evening gam...</p></p><h2>Goodness and Light: Readings for Advent and Christmas</h2><p><i>An anthology of inspired readings from cherished writers to enrich you every day of the season</i><br><br>From the first day of Advent through Christmas Eve to the Epiphany, these 45 readings from beloved writers, classical and contemporary, will surprise you, touch your with love, and comfort you with peace.

What if we read the gospels as if that were true? In his book <i>Contemplating Christ</i>,<i></i>Vincent Pizzuto offers an exploration of the interior life for modern contemplatives that is as beautiful as it is compelling. With an emphasis on the gospels and Christian mystical tradition, his book explores ancient themes in new and surprising ways. Drawing on his rich experience as an academic and priest, Pizzuto gradually unfolds the Christian mystery of deification to which the whole of biblical revelation and the Christian contemplative life are ordered: through the incarnation, we have all been made &#x201c;other Christs&#x201d; in the world.</p></p><p>"Until the Christian world begins to read its own sources with the contemplative mind that is offered here, I see little hope for its in depth renewal. The argumentative mind that has dominated so much of our recent past has not served history well. Vincent Pizzuto is offering us both inspiration and very readable scholarship here. This is the Great Tradition!"Fr. Richard Rohr, OFM, Center for Action and Contemplation, Albuquerque, New Mexico<br><br>"Denizens of the land of silence owe a debt of gratitude to Vincent Pizzuto for the gift of this book. Clearly written and based on solid scholarship, grounded in Scripture itself, the author clarifies the simplest of truths: to become a contemplative is quite simply a matter of becoming fully normal. Paradoxically our becoming natural involves a lifetime of loves soul-sifting. As Meister Eckhart puts it: `The eye with which I see God is the same eye with which God sees me.' One seeing, one loving, one knowing."Martin Laird, OSA, Professor of Early Christian Studies, Villanova University<br><br>"A magnificent, nutritious book of spiritual counsel, both visionary and compassionate! <i>Contemplating Christ</i> patiently trains us to rethink familiar texts, feelings, and attitudes by recovering the grandeur of the cosmic Christ from the Gospels, the hymn of Colossians 1, and the teachers of ancient Christianity. This work of mystagogy grasps anew the `transgressive' power of the Incarnation that `has made mystics of us all,' and offers practical ways to live into our wondrous `divinized' identity after baptism. At the same time, it performs microsurgery upon our spiritual practices and predilections (its rethinking of asceticism and of demonic power is particularly fine). Like an ancient painting restored, vivid colors burst anew from the countercultural beauty of the Gospel. A feast for the spirit!"Michael Cameron, Professor of Historical Theology, University of Portland<br><br>"A remarkable book."<i>Theological Studies</i><br><br>"Pizzuto demonstrates a wide expanse and great depth of knowledge regarding contemplative spirituality."<i>Catholic Book Review</i><br><br>"This book, with a focus on the incarnate Christ, seeks to introduce readers both to modern methods of interpreting Scripture and to the ancient and integral contemplative tradition within Christianity."<i>New Testament Abstracts</i><br><br>"General readership will find both gentle scholarly engagement with Christian scripture, contemplative traditions, and mysticism, as well as personal observations about how this way of life has deepened the author's own meditative practices. For readers who wish to take a deeper dive in to the topics Pizzuto introduces, he provides a helpful appendix on the origins of Christian mysticism and an annotated glossary of terms that appear throughout the text."<i>Reading Religion</i></p><h2>Occultation and Other Stories</h2><p><b>Winner of the 2010 Shirley Jackson Award, nine stories of cosmic horror from the heir apparent to Lovecraft&#x2019;s throne.</b><br><br>Laird Barron has emerged as one of the strongest voices in modern horror and dark fantasy fiction, building on the eldritch tradition pioneered by writers such as H.

The authors do contribute two patterns each to this book, and it turns out, they are just as good at picking folks to design hats as they are at designing them themselves. This book has 25 hat designs by 19 different designers. Texture, colorwork, lace - whatever you most love to knit or have wanted to dabble in, you'll find it here. I have a deep-rooted fear of Fair Isle, but Gudrun Johnson's Hued Toque is calling me. There are hats for men and women, and hats that would suit both. Hats that are more decorative and hats that are cozy warm. The variety of design is huge, and if like me, you're a little bit tired of chunky everything, not one of these hats is knit out of chunky or bulky yarn - Hooray!" - Jillian Moreno, Knitty.com<br><br>"Got a few hours to spare?

The welcoming arms of the boisterous, loving O'Brien clan embrace her and her son. But accepting their support seems to further alienate her son's father, Connor O'Brien. His parents' divorce and his career as a high-powered divorce attorney have left him jaded about marriage.<br><br>Then everything changes. Will the possibility of a future without Heather make Connor look at love and his career differently? Heather's just about given up on her old dreams&#x2014;of love, of family and especially of Driftwood Cottage, the home she secretly wishes were hers. It's going to take a lot of persuasion&#x2014;and some help from the O'Brien family&#x2014;to make Heather believe that some dreams are worth fighting for.<br><br></p><p>With her roots firmly planted in the South, Sherryl Woods has written many of her more than 100 books in that distinctive setting, whether in her home state of Virginia, her adopted state, Florida, or her much-adored South Carolina. Sherryl is best known for her ability to creating endearing small town communities and families. She is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of over 75 romances for Silhouette Desire and Special Edition.<br><br>Heather Donovan propped open the front door and stood just inside the brightly lit storefront in Chesapeake Shores so she could inhale the scent of sea air from the bay across Shore Road. Turning slowly, she studied the stacks of colorful fabric bolts that had to be sorted and displayed, the unopened boxes of quilting supplies and the quilt racks that still required assembly. Her pride and joy, the carefully crafted shelving units, had been built to her specifications by her son's grandfather, famed architect Mick O'Brien, for whom her son, little Mick, was named.<br><br>Seeing it all coming together was a little overwhelming. Not just opening a business, but all of it&#x2014;moving to this quaint town, deciding to raise her son on her own, giving up on a future with Connor O'Brien&#x2014;these were all huge steps. Her mind still reeled when she thought about the recent changes in her life. She might embrace the changes, but that didn't mean she wasn't scared to death.<br><br>If anyone had told her a few months ago that she would leave the man she loved more than anything, that she would take their son and move from Baltimore to a small seaside town and embark on a whole new career, Heather would have laughed at the absurdity of the predictions. Even though Connor stubbornly had refused to consider marriage, she'd thought they had a good life, that they were committed to one another. She'd believed that so strongly that she'd ignored her parents'&#x2014;actually it had been mostly her mother's&#x2014;warnings about the mistake she was making by having a child with Connor without a ring on her finger.<br><br>But, in fact, they&#x2014;she, Connor and their son&#x2014;might have gone on exactly like that for years if she hadn't seen how Connor's career as a divorce lawyer was chipping away at their relationship, how his anger at his parents was corrupting their day-to-day lives. She didn't like the embittered man she'd seen him becoming, and he seemed to have no desire to change.<br><br>It wasn't as if she'd made her decision to break up lightly. She'd gone away for several weeks, leaving their son with Connor's family while she'd pondered what was best for her future and for her child's. She hadn't been happy about the conclusion she'd reached, that she needed to start a new life on her own, but she'd made peace with it. And, in time, she knew she'd find the fulfillment that had eluded her with Connor.<br><br>Not that she could envision a day when she'd stop loving him, she thought even now, months after making the decision. She sighed at how difficult it sometimes was to reconcile emotions with common sense and facing reality, especially with a precious little boy as a constant reminder of what she'd given up.<br><br>A bell over the shop's front door tinkled merrily, interrupting her thoughts. Megan O'Brien stepped inside, carrying her grandson who beamed at the sight of Heather.<br><br>"Mama!" he cried, holding out his chubby little arms. Just over a year old now, he was the joy of Heather's life.<br><br>"He was missing you," Megan explained, then gave her a commiserating look. "And I thought you might be needing a glimpse of him about now. I know you're still not over all those weeks the two of you spent apart."<br><br>"Thank you," Heather said, reaching for her son.<br><br>"Feeling overwhelmed?" Megan asked with the kind of insight that Heather had come to treasure.<br><br>So many times in the past few months she'd regretted that Megan wouldn't be her mother-in-law. In many ways Heather felt closer to Connor's mother than she did to her own mother back in Ohio. A wonderful salt-of-the-earth woman who went to church on Sundays, volunteered at a homeless shelter and in a children's hospital, Bridget Donovan had an endless store of compassion for everyone except her own daughter. She flatly refused to accept that any daughter of hers would willingly choose not to marry the father of her child.<br><br>Heather sighed. As if marriage to Connor had ever been an option, no matter how desperately she might have hoped for it.<br><br>Heather bounced baby Mick in her arms as she nodded in response to Megan's question. "You're right about feeling overwhelmed," she said, gesturing around the store. "I have no idea where to start. What if opening a shop, especially here, is a huge mistake? I don't know anything about running a business. And being here, in this town, surrounded by O'Briens, what was I thinking? Why on earth did I let you talk me into this?"<br><br>"Because you knew it was a brilliant idea," Megan said at once, obviously still pleased with herself for coming up with this solution for Heather's future.<br><br>"Still, doubts are understandable," she consoled Heather. "You've made a lot of changes recently. All good ones, I think. As for starting your own business, this is a natural fit for you. The minute I saw those handmade quilts of yours, I knew it. You do absolutely beautiful work. Everyone in town is going to want to own one of your quilts or have you teach them how to make their own."<br><br>Megan fingered a small folk art quilt of a bay scene as she spoke. "This one, for instance, is a treasure. How can you bear to part with it? And at this price? It needs to cost twice as much."<br><br>"The price is fine. I was just experimenting," Heather said modestly, still astonished that anyone thought her hobby could turn into a thriving business. She had always enjoyed quilting, and it had filled the quiet evenings while Connor studied. She'd never envisioned it as anything more than a hobby.<br><br>In fact, her college degree had been in literature. She'd never quite figured out what to do with that besides teach. After two years in an out-of-control Baltimore high school classroom, she'd gratefully quit when she'd become pregnant with Connor's baby.<br><br>She gestured to the quilt Megan was admiring. "If you aren't just saying that to calm me down, if you really like it, I'll make one for you."<br><br>Megan's eyes brightened. "I'd love it, but I will pay you for it, and I swear I'm going to talk you into doubling the price."<br><br>"Absolutely not."<br><br>"Well, that's what I'm paying," Megan countered just as stubbornly. "You've a business to run, after all."<br><br>Heather sighed. "Starting a business is just one of my concerns these days," she admitted. "What about moving out on Connor? Was that the right decision, Megan?" She couldn't seem to keep a wistful note out of her voice.<br><br>"Even that," Megan assured her. "My son is stubborn, and you've given him exactly the wake-up call he needed." She patted Heather's hand. "He loves you. Just tuck that knowledge away. He'll come around if you're patient."<br><br>"For how long?" Heather asked. "We met our freshman year in college, dated for four years, moved in together when he was in law school. When I found out I was pregnant, I was so sure we'd get married, especially when he encouraged me to quit my job to be a full-time mom. I was certain we were finally going to be a real family, the kind I'd always wanted. He even said that's what he wanted, too, just without a marriage license."<br><br>She waved off her regrets. "I should have known better than to expect him to change his mind. Connor always told me he had no intention of ever marrying, that he didn't believe in marriage. It's not as if I didn't understand the rules from the very beginning."<br><br>"People don't make rules about things like that," Megan said dismissively. "They just let the past control the future. In Connor's case, his attitude is all because of what happened between his father and me. Now that Mick and I have remarried and started over, I'm convinced Connor will see that love can endure all kinds of trials, including divorce."<br><br>Heather smiled at her optimism. "Have you met Connor? He's stubborn as a mule. Once he gets an idea into his head, he won't let go of it. And look how long it's been since I moved out. It was last Thanksgiving when I left to think things over, January when I officially left him. It'll be Easter soon, and he still hasn't shown any signs of changing his mind. He may not be entirely happy that I'm gone, but he's not doing anything at all to change the situation."<br><br>Megan grinned. "I'm married to a man just like that, his father. Believe me, there are ways of getting through to their hard heads." She glanced pointedly at the boy in Heather's arms. "And you've your ace in the hole right there. Connor adores his son."<br><br>Heather shook her head. "A couple can't build a future around a child. It's not fair. My parents did that. They stayed in a miserable marriage because of me. They thought it would be best, but it wasn't. The tension was unbearable. I won't have that for my son."<br><br>"I'm not suggesting that you be together for your child, only that he'll keep you in Connor's orbit while he gets his feet back under him and realizes how much he loves you both. Having you with him was entirely too comfortable. He had it all his own way. The stance you've taken is the smart one. Eventually he'll realize what he needs to do to have the two of you back again."<br><br>"I hope you're right," Heather admitted, though she wasn't counting on it. In fact, if things didn't work out with Connor, it could make her decision to move to Chesapeake Shores where she'd be surrounded by his family the worst one she'd made in years. The O'Briens might provide an enviable support system, but she'd be reminded of what could have been every minute of every day.<br><br>"Of course I'm right," Megan said confidently. "Now tell me what I can do to help you get organized in here. Do you have a system?"<br><br>Even to her own ears, Heather's laugh had an edge of hysteria about it. "If only," she said, glancing around at the chaos. She regarded Megan hopefully. "Are you sure you have some time to spare?"<br><br>"Of course I do. At Mick's insistence, I've hired a very competent assistant at the gallery, and things are under control. In the meantime, I'll let her know I'll be right next door if she needs me," she said, flipping open her cell phone. When she'd made the call, she told Heather, "Now, just put me to work."<br><br>Heather didn't hesitate. "If you could start opening those boxes, I could begin sorting the fabric for the displays," she suggested, settling Mick into the playpen she'd already set up in a corner. He uttered an immediate howl of protest, then spotted one of his favorite toys and was quickly absorbed with that.<br><br>Heather and Megan worked in companionable silence for a while before Megan inquired, "Have you told Connor about the shop yet? He didn't mention it last time we spoke and I certainly didn't want to be the one to fill him in."<br><br>Heather stiffened. "It hasn't come up. Truthfully, we barely exchange a dozen words when I drop Mick off to spend the day with him. I haven't even told him I've moved here. He reaches me on my cell phone when he needs to, so it's not as if it really matters where I've settled. I suppose if I'd run off to California, he might have a legitimate complaint, but I'm barely an hour away. Nothing's changed in terms of his schedule to see little Mick."<br><br>Megan looked distressed by her response. "Oh, Heather, you need to tell him," she said. "And you need to do it before he comes home for a visit and discovers it for himself or before someone else in the family blabs. He'll be furious that you've kept it from him."<br><br>Heather shrugged. "It'll just be one more thing to add to the list. He's already angry that I refused to move back in. To be honest, he wasn't all that happy when I insisted on keeping little Mick with me after I'd left him here with you while I was trying to sort through things and get my head on straight. He apparently thought the arrangement was going to be permanent."<br><br>"There's no question that he liked having the baby here with him and the rest of the family," Megan acknowledged. "We all did. But I think everyone except Connor understood it was only temporary."<br><br>Heather regarded her with sorrow. "Sometimes I think I'm destined to keep making things worse between Connor and me. If we talk at all, we're at odds over everything."<br><br>Megan smiled at that. "It's only awkward right now because you won't give him what he wants&#x2014;an unconditional commitment that doesn't include marriage. He has to learn that he can't always have things on his own terms."<br><br>"But aren't I doing the same thing, expecting to have things on <em>my </em>terms?" Heather asked.<br><br>Megan regarded her thoughtfully. "I suppose that's true. Maybe it's just because I think you're the one who's right that I'm not blaming any of this standoff on you. I think two people who love each other and have a child together ought to at least try marriage, that they ought to be fighting to make it work."<br><br>She sighed. "Goodness knows, I spent years trying to make things work with Mick before I took the drastic step of leaving. Even in hindsight, I don't think I had a choice by then, though I know I should have handled things differently and much better where all of our children were concerned. I still regret that, and I'd never have forgiven myself if I'd simply run at the first sign of trouble, rather than leaving as a last resort."<br><br>Heather grinned at her. "But here you are, together again. Happy endings still happen. Why can't Connor see that, especially when it's right in front of his face?"<br><br>"I fear it's because he doesn't have a romantic bone in his body," Megan replied sorrowfully. "He's become cynical when it comes to love. Mick and I did that to him, and that job of his&#x2014;dealing with bitter divorces every single day&#x2014;has reaffirmed his jaded views."<br><br>"Then what makes you think he'll ever come around?" Heather asked.<br><br>"Because I <em>am </em>a romantic," Megan said, smiling. "I believe in the power of love. And I know how deeply he cares about the people he has let into his heart&#x2014;his sisters and his brother, his grandmother, even Mick when they're not battling over one thing or another."<br><br>"I saw that side of him, too, or thought I did," Heather said softly, though her voice lacked the conviction of Megan's.<br><br>"Then don't give up on Connor," Megan advised. "He'll find his way back to you. I believe that, too."<br><br></p><h2>Raise Clairaudient Energy (Cyndi Dale&#39;s Essential Energy Library, 3)</h2><p><p>Obtain the guidance you need to make better decisions, improve your health, and take purposeful action with renowned author Cyndi Dale.

Unlike other girls my age, I couldn&#x2019;t invite anyone to sleep over or have a birthday party with my classmates as guests. Bea Davenport had laid that rule on my mother. She didn&#x2019;t want strange children coming to the house and gawking at Wyndemere or disturbing the grounds. I couldn&#x2019;t have breakfast, lunch, or especially dinner with Ryder or, for that matter, Samantha when she was no longer an infant. Bea Davenport wouldn&#x2019;t permit me to be in either of their rooms by the time Ryder was eight and Samantha was five, and she continually discouraged both of them from coming to mine even when they were older.<br> <br>For Samantha, that was like reaching into the candy jar when no one was looking. The moment her mother left the house, she would drop what she was doing and sneak through the hallways to stand in my bedroom doorway, hoping I would invite her in to play or just to talk. When Ryder was older, he was more in his stepmother&#x2019;s face about it, marching right past her to come to see me and often, again out of spite, inviting one of my friends to go rowing with us on the lake. Bea was furious about that and got Dr. Davenport to discourage it by telling Ryder there were insurance concerns. He was to use the rowboat only when either he or Bea was present, which was rare.<br> <br>I did recall the two times Dr. Davenport took my mother and me, Ryder, and Samantha out in his motorboat, but we were all very young and he wasn&#x2019;t as busy as he was now. In fact, his motorboat was so neglected; it was in need of repair. It bobbed at the dock like some forgotten relative trying to get his attention.<br> <br>Bea Davenport did other things to keep us in our place. To this day, my mother and I were forbidden to enter the house from the front. Even when there was two feet of snow, we would have to go around to the rear entrance to get to our rooms. It was the same entrance where most deliveries were made, with my mother there to accept them. If Bea could, she would have stamped our foreheads with the word servants.<br> <br>With a voice that was strident and nasal, Bea would snap the rules at us frequently, especially adding newly conceived prohibitions like staying out of the gazebo and off the tennis court. If I did go through the house for any reason, I wasn&#x2019;t to touch anything. I recalled how she had one of the maids clean and polish the banister after I had gone upstairs with my mother, especially when my mother was caring for Sam. My mother always had my hands washed before we approached the Davenport children, but that didn&#x2019;t matter. It was as if I had some disease inherent in my skin. I remember feeling very dirty whenever I was in Bea&#x2019;s presence. She looked at me closely, searching for some blotch, some smudge, anything to confirm her suspicions that I was not only imperfect but infectious.<br> <br>My mother was never to touch her jewelry and, of course, to be sure no maid ever did. Because my mother was the house manager, a title Bea would never pronounce, any mistake was her fault, down to having what Bea considered the wrong brand of margarine. It did no good, either, to protest that Mrs. Marlene had been serving it for years. There was a new sun shining on this house now. Furniture and paintings were shifted about, and window shades were opened and closed differently to move shadows from their traditional nests. Bea was always redecorating something. Only Dr. Davenport&#x2019;s office was off-limits to her.<br> <br>If there was even the smallest impression that my mother and I were a little more than household servants, that impression was crushed the way you might stamp down on an insect. I think that was the reason she made the front entrance so sacrosanct. We couldn&#x2019;t come through if we took off our shoes. We couldn&#x2019;t come through even if we could remove our inferior souls.<br> <br>Most of the time, the pathway to the rear was cleared of snow. Mr. Stark, who managed the grounds, the long driveway, and all the outside fixtures, was very fond of my mother and me and was at the house especially early on weekdays in the winter to be sure we had an easy time going in and out. He was twenty years older than my mother, but I was sure, being a widower, he dreamed of her being more to him than simply a fellow employee. He&#x2019;d leap at an invitation to have dinner with us and never forgot my mother&#x2019;s birthday or mine. Despite his balding head of gray hair and the deep wrinkles worn into his face, he was stout and fit. My mother called him a walking tree trunk, even to his face.<br> <br>&#x201c;George, you have bark for skin,&#x201d; she would say, half-kiddingly, especially when he wore a coat too thin for the colder weather. But there wasn&#x2019;t anything she could say that wouldn&#x2019;t bring a smile to his face.<br> <br>In fact, there were times when I wondered if George Stark might be my father. He had been working at Wyndemere long before my mother arrived here, and once, when my mother was in the mood to tell me about her early days and my birth, she admitted she had needed help caring for me as well as caring for Ryder when I was born about two years after him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Stark&#x2019;s daughter Cathy helped me out for your first year. She stayed in what is your room. Dr. Davenport approved, but of course, that was before his second marriage. By the time his new wife moved in, I was able to handle both you and Ryder, so Cathy went home.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wondered why you always had me call her Aunt Cathy,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just a kindness. She has a younger brother, Stuart, but they don&#x2019;t see each other much. Sometimes you have to adopt a family,&#x201d; my mother said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too bad some nice young man in Hillsborough hasn&#x2019;t discovered how wonderful a wife Cathy Stark would make. The hospital here is lucky to have her nursing in the ER. Whatever she does, she does with great dedication and responsibility.&#x201d;<br> <br>Aunt Cathy was always so glad to see me and never forgot to bring me a present on my birthday and Christmas, just as her father never forgot. Suspicion ran deep, but I didn&#x2019;t see much resemblance between myself and Cathy or with Mr. Stark. Maybe that was because I romanticized too much about my real father, dreaming of a handsome and exciting young man who had swooped in one day and swept my mother off her feet. It was why I searched so hard for some clues, a letter, something. It was easy to imagine what it would say. Sometimes I invented the idea that he was already married at the time or that he was from a family so rich and powerful that the idea of his marrying my mother was practically science fiction.<br> <br>In fact, I used to compose the love letters I imagined he would sneak into the house.<br> <br>Dear Emma,<br> <br>I was thinking so hard about you today and remembering how comforting and wonderful your smile for me could be that I forgot an important appointment. My wife was upset and demanded to know what I was thinking. I am so tempted to tell her. I am thinking about the most beautiful woman in the world. I am thinking about her kiss and how she embraced me. I am thinking of the minutes and hours that were precious jewels in my bank of memories, and I am thinking about the child we created out of our love.<br> <br>I made up different names to use as his signature, most taken from great romances I had read for extra credit in literature class, like Antony from Antony and Cleopatra or Tristan from Tristan and Isolde. I even signed one Romeo. As soon as I finished my letter and had read it at least ten times, I would tear it into shreds, afraid my mother would find it and be upset. It was always like ripping up a beautiful dream. Yet it was something I thought I might never stop doing, even when I was older and entering high school.<br> <br>Hillsborough was the township we lived in, and Ryder, Sam, and I attended Hillsborough Central School, which had the elementary school adjacent to the junior-senior high school. I went to school on a school bus, but Ryder and Sam were driven to school by Dr. and Bea Davenport&#x2019;s limo driver, Parker Thomson, a forty-five-year-old African-American man with premature chalk-white hair that made it look like a piece of a cloud had settled on his head. He had been one of Dr. Davenport&#x2019;s patients and was devoted to him. He was always very nice to me, waving and smiling whenever he saw me, but less so when Bea was present.<br> <br>Ryder wanted me to ride with him and Sam, but Bea Davenport forbade it, and to my surprise and disappointment, Dr. Davenport rarely challenged anything she had decided regarding the house or the help. I thought he might make an exception when it came to me, but he didn&#x2019;t and was quick to dismiss Ryder&#x2019;s appeal to override his stepmother&#x2019;s rules. When I complained to my mother, she said perhaps he didn&#x2019;t want the distractions that came from domestic arguments.<br> <br>&#x201c;A cardiac specialist and surgeon like Dr. Davenport certainly doesn&#x2019;t want to leave the house for the hospital with any unnecessary worry on his shoulders. He could miss something important, and someone might die.&#x201d;<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t deny he was a very busy and dedicated doctor who, according to my mother, &#x201c;took his responsibilities as seriously as a bishop who had to report to the Almighty. Few men have life and death in their hands as many times a week as Dr. Davenport has,&#x201d; she said. But that still seemed like a weak excuse for his disinterest in what went on at Wyndemere.<br> <br>From what I knew of him and from the way I heard people in the community talk about him, it did seem as if he walked on water. If there was anyone I really tiptoed around, it was Dr. Davenport, but he really never chastised me for anything more than not listening to my mother or obeying her strictly. From time to time, whenever he did see me, he asked how I was doing in school, but his questions were quick and to the point. Invariably, he would simply say, &#x201c;Keep up the good work,&#x201d; quickly stroke my head like he might pet a kitten, and that would be that. I didn&#x2019;t think he really cared all that much whether I did well in school or not. He was simply being polite. For some people, good etiquette was sewn into their skin. It was as automatic as breathing. Still, it meant something to me to catch his attention, even if only for a few seconds a week, usually outside the house and away from Bea Davenport&#x2019;s disapproving eyes.<br> <br>Dr. Davenport stood just a little over five foot ten, but he always seemed taller to me. I was always afraid to look him in the eyes. When I was little and my mother told me he operated on people&#x2019;s hearts, I thought he could see and know everything about someone, even his or her thoughts. His eyes were sterling-silver gray and piercingly intense whenever he spoke to anyone, especially me. He was very handsome in a distinguished sort of way, always closely shaven, his lips firm and straight. He went to an old-fashioned barber who cut his pecan-brown hair so precisely that there was never a strand too long or too short. Everything about his appearance was perfect. He wore a shirt and a tie like a uniform. My mother said he was one of those rare doctors &#x201c;who actually practice what they preach.&#x201d;<br> <br>His day began with an early-morning run along the banks of the lake, even on very cold days, and he watched his diet. When he did have a day off, he would go rowing on the lake for hours. As a consequence, he had a lean body and a ruddy complexion. What attracted my attention especially when I was little was how long his fingers were. If he shook hands with someone, his hand seemed to wrap completely around the other&#x2019;s. Everything he did, he did purposefully, slowly, as if placing something on a table was as critical a motion as the first incision to begin a heart operation.<br> <br>He was as careful about his words as well. Whenever I heard him talking to Ryder or Sam, I smiled at how precise he was about what he wanted them to do or remember. He always repeated the important things, and when I asked my mother about that, she said, &#x201c;Dr. Davenport believes few people listen the first time, and he&#x2019;s used to dictating medical information, how many pills to take, how often, and what to avoid while taking it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe he thinks everyone&#x2019;s his patient, even his children,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Even me!&#x201d;<br> <br>She gave me a strange look and then nodded. I caught her smiling to herself and wondered what I had said to bring some humor to mind. Maybe it was because she had thought something similar about Dr. Davenport but would never say it. She would never do or say anything even slightly disrespectful when it came to him. I don&#x2019;t think it was because she thought he was so much better than everyone, including herself, as much as it was because she had been here when he had suffered the loss of his parents and his first wife and then had cared for his children.<br> <br>I used to be jealous of how well and lovingly she took care of Sam especially. I was three when Sam was born, and for those early years, at least, because my mother had me to care for, too, when Aunt Cathy wasn&#x2019;t available, Bea Davenport permitted me to be beside my mother when she looked after Sam. But I was forbidden to touch her. Sometimes when Bea wasn&#x2019;t in the house, however, my mother let me hold Sam&#x2019;s bottle while she drank. A real live baby, as opposed to a doll, was fascinating to watch. My mother assured me that Sam recognized me and smiled at me. I think she was trying to contain my jealousy.<br> <br>Anyway, that was also how Ryder and I were able to spend more time together when we were little, when I accompanied my mother to do something for him or care for Sam, especially when Bea Davenport was out of the house. She was always attending this or that charity function and getting her picture on the society page of the local newspaper. Ryder got used to me being around him and loved to teach me how to work some of his toys. We would watch television together often during those years, too. Until Bea Davenport built &#x201c;the Berlin Wall&#x201d; between us in the house, Ryder used to say, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re all like brother and sisters.&#x201d;<br> <br>He wasn&#x2019;t saying that now, and it wasn&#x2019;t only because Bea Davenport insisted there be boundaries between us. No, there was another reason, or at least I hoped so. Deep in my heart, I felt it when he looked at me thinking I wasn&#x2019;t aware of it, but, like other boys at school, he suddenly realized I was capable of stirring him up, and maybe I could even be found in one of his sexual fantasies. I knew I had some about him. Well, maybe more than some.<br> <br>One day recently, when he came to my room after school because I had asked him to help me with my math homework, which was really just an excuse to be close to him, he appeared sooner than I had expected. I had just started to change my clothes and was in my bra and panties when he stepped through my open doorway. My mother was in the kitchen helping Mrs. Marlene.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; he said, his face bursting with what I thought was delightful surprise, a rich crimson shade.<br> <br>I shrugged and reached for my sweatshirt slowly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the same as my two-piece bathing suit,&#x201d; I said. Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t. My panties were almost transparent, but I wanted to impress him with how sophisticated I was and how mature my body had become.<br> <br>He nodded and went to my desk to look at my math text while I put on my jeans. He concentrated...</p><h2>Rituals and Spells of Santeria</h2><p>Santeria is an earth religion. That is, it is a magico-religious system that has its roots in nature and natural forces. Each Orisha or saint is identified with a force of nature and with a human interest or endeavor. Chango, for instance, is the god of fire, thunder, and lightening, but he is also the symbol of justice and protects his followers against his enemies. He also symbolizes passion and virility and is often invoked in works of seduction. Oshun, on the other hand, symbolizes river waters, love and marriage. She is essentially the archtype of joy and pleasure.</p><p></p><h2>Favorite Poems (Dover Thrift Editions: Poetry)</h2><p>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807&#x2013;1882) was the most popular American poet of his time, and one of the most famous American poets of all time. It has been said that certain of his poems &#x2014; the long narratives Evangeline and The Song of Hiawatha most notably &#x2014; were once read in every literate home in America. A former teacher who fulfilled his dream to make a living as a poet, Longfellow taught at Bowdoin and Harvard, was eventually honored for his poetry with degrees from Oxford and Cambridge, and is one of the few Americans to have a monument dedicated to his memory in Westminster Abbey. This choice collection of his works, which reflects his mastery of a rich variety of poetic forms and meters, includes one of his best narrative poems, The Courtship of Miles Standish. Here, too, are such famous poems as "The Village Blacksmith," "The Wreck of the Hesperus," "The Children's Hour," "Paul Revere's Ride," and other poems on subjects ranging from lost youth and Giotto's Tower to slavery and the building of a ship. Includes a selection from the Common Core State Standards Initiative: "Paul Revere's Ride."</p><p>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was born in 1807 in Portland, Maine, and he became a professor of modern languages at Harvard. His most famous narrative poems include The Song of Hiawatha, Paul Reveres Ride, &#34;The Village Blacksmith,&#34; &#34;The Wreck of the Hesperus.&#34; From his friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, Longfellow got a brief outline of a story from which he composed one of his most favorite poems, &#39;Evangeline&#39;. The original story had Evangeline wandering about New England in search of her bridegroom. One of the first poets to take the landscape and stories of North America as his subjects, Longfellow became immensely popular all over the world, and he was the first American commemorated in the Poets Corner of Westminster Abbey. He was given honorary degrees at the great universities of Oxford and Cambridge, invited to Windsor by Queen Victoria, and called by request upon the Prince of Wales. He was also chosen a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and of the Spanish Academy. He died on March 24, 1882.</p><h2>How We Do Harm: A Doctor Breaks Ranks About Being Sick in America</h2><p><p><i>How We Do Harm</i> exposes the underbelly of healthcare today&#x2015;the overtreatment of the rich, the under treatment of the poor, the financial conflicts of interest that determine the care that physicians' provide, insurance companies that don't demand the best (or even the least expensive) care, and pharmaceutical companies concerned with selling drugs, regardless of whether they improve health or do harm. </p><p>Dr. Otis Brawley is the chief medical and scientific officer of The American Cancer Society, an oncologist with a dazzling clinical, research, and policy career. <i>How We Do Harm pulls back the curtain </i>on how medicine is really practiced in America. Brawley tells of doctors who select treatment based on payment they will receive, rather than on demonstrated scientific results; hospitals and pharmaceutical companies that seek out patients to treat even if they are not actually ill (but as long as their insurance will pay); a public primed to swallow the latest pill, no matter the cost; and rising healthcare costs for unnecessary&#x2015;and often unproven&#x2015;treatments that we all pay for. Brawley calls for rational healthcare, healthcare drawn from results-based, scientifically justifiable treatments, and not just the peddling of hot new drugs.</p><p>Brawley's personal history &#x2013; from a childhood in the gang-ridden streets of black Detroit, to the green hallways of Grady Memorial Hospital, the largest public hospital in the U.S., to the boardrooms of The American Cancer Society&#x2015;results in a passionate view of medicine and the politics of illness in America - and a deep understanding of healthcare today. <i>How We Do Harm</i> is his well-reasoned manifesto for change.</p></p><p><p>DR. OTIS BRAWLEY is the chief medical and scientific officer and executive vice president of the American Cancer Society. Dr. Brawley currently serves as professor of hematology, oncology, medicine and epidemiology at Emory University. He is also a CNN medical consultant. He is a graduate of the University of Chicago, Pritzker School of Medicine, and completed a residency in internal medicine at University Hospitals of Cleveland, Case-Western Reserve University, and a fellowship in medical oncology at the National Cancer Institute. </p><p>PAUL GOLDBERG is an award-winning investigative reporter who covers oncology for The Cancer Letter, a weekly publication focused on drug development and the politics of cancer.

In a plastic bag, she carries an object wrapped in a moist towel.<br>She is not bleeding. She is not in shock. Her vital signs are okay. There is no reason to think that she will collapse on the spot. Since she is not truly an emergency patient, she is triaged to the back of the line, and other folks, those in immediate distress, get in for treatment ahead of her. She waits on a gurney in a cavernous, green hallway.<br>The &#x201c;chief complaint&#x201d; on her chart at Grady Memorial Hospital, in downtown Atlanta, might have set off a wave of nausea at a hospital in a white suburb or almost any place in the civilized world. It reads, &#x201c;My breast has fallen off. Can you reattach it?&#x201d;<br>She waits for at least four hours&#x2014;likely, five or six. The triage nurse doesn&#x2019;t seek to determine the whereabouts of the breast.<br>Obviously, the breast is in the bag.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>I am making rounds on the tenth floor when I get a page from Tammie Quest in the Emergency Department.<br>At Grady, we take care of patients who can&#x2019;t pay, patients no one wants. They come to us with their bleeding wounds, their run-amok diabetes, their end-stage tumors, their drama. You deal with this wreckage for a while and you develop a coping mechanism. You detach. That&#x2019;s why many doctors, nurses, and social workers here come off as if they have departed for a less turbulent planet.<br>Tammie is not like that. She emotes, and I like having her as the queen of ER&#x2014;an experienced black woman who gives a shit. When Dr. Quest pages me, I know it isn&#x2019;t because she needs a social interaction. It has to be something serious.<br>&#x201c;We are wanted in the ER,&#x201d; I tell my team.<br>The cancer team today consists of a fellow, a resident, two medical students, and yours truly, in a flowing white coat, as the attending physician. I lead the way down the hall. Having grown up Catholic, I can&#x2019;t help thinking of the med students and young doctors as altar boys following a priest.<br>I am a medical oncologist, the kind of doctor who gives chemotherapy. My other interests are epidemiology and biostatistics. I am someone you might ask whether a drug works, whether you should get a cancer screening test, and whether a white man&#x2019;s cancer differs from a black man&#x2019;s cancer. You can also ask me if we are winning the &#x201c;war&#x201d; on the cluster of diseases we call cancer. As chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society&#x2014;a position I have held since 2007&#x2014;I often end up quoted in the newspapers, and I am on television a lot. In addition to my academic, journalistic, and public-policy roles, I have been taking care of cancer patients at Grady for nearly a decade, first as the founding director of the cancer center, and now as chief doctor at the ACS.<br>My retinue behind me, I keep up a fast pace, this side of a jog. Bill Bernstein, the fellow, is the most senior of the group. Bill is a Newton, Massachusetts, suburbanite, still boyish. He is having trouble adjusting to the South, to Atlanta, to its inner city. He is trying, but it&#x2019;s hard to miss that black people and poor people perplex him. Contact with so much despair makes him awkward. But he has a good heart, a surfeit of common sense&#x2014;and he is smart. Whatever we teach him at Grady will make him a better doctor wherever he ends up.<br>Grady suffers from what the administration here calls a &#x201c;vertical transportation problem.&#x201d; Our elevators are slow at best, broken at worst. We head for the stairs, rushing down to the first floor, then through long, green hallways into the ER.<br>Grady is a monument to racism. Racism is built into it, as is poverty, as is despair. Shaped like a capital letter <i>H,</i> Grady is essentially two hospitals with a hallway&#x2014;a crossover&#x2014;in the middle to keep things separate but equal for sixteen stories.<br>In the 1950s and &#x2019;60s, white patients were wheeled into the front section, which faces the city. Blacks went to the back of the <i>H.</i> This structure&#x2014;built in 1953&#x2014;was actually an improvement over the previous incarnation. The Big H&#x2014;the current Grady&#x2014;replaced two separate buildings&#x2014;the whites got a brick building, the blacks a run-down wood-frame structure. Older Atlantans continue to refer to the place in a chilling plural, the Gradys.<br>You end up at Grady for four main reasons. It could happen because you have no insurance and are denied care at a private hospital, or because you are unconscious when you arrive by ambulance. When your lights are out, you are in no position to ask to be taken to a cleaner, better-lit, suburban palace of medicine. A third, small contingent are older black folks with insurance, who could go anywhere but have retained a dim memory of Grady as the only Atlanta hospital that accepted us. The fourth category, injured cops and firemen, know that we see a lot of shock and trauma and are good at it. We are their ER of choice.<br>Today, our 950-bed behemoth stands for another form of segregation: poor versus rich, separate but with no pretense of equality. Grady is Atlanta&#x2019;s safety-net hospital. It is also the largest hospital in the United States.<br>The ER, arguably the principal entry point to Grady, was built in the center of the hospital, filling in some of the <i>H</i> on the first floor. To build it, Grady administrators got some federal funds in time for the 1996 Summer Olympics. This fueled financial machinations, which led to criminal charges, which led to prison terms. (In retrospect, the bulk of the money was put to good use. Many of the victims of the Olympic Park bombing came through our ER.)<br>The hallways here are incredibly crowded, even by the standards of inner-city hospitals. Patients are triaged into three color-coded lines&#x2014;surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics&#x2014;and placed on gurneys two-deep, leaving almost no room for staff to squeeze through.<br>You might see a homeless woman drifting in and out of consciousness next to a Georgia Tech student bloodied from being pistol-whipped in an armed robbery, next to a fifty-seven-year-old suburban secretary terrified by a sudden loss of vision, next to a twenty-eight-year-old hooker writhing in pain that shoots up from her lower abdomen, next to a conventioneer who blacked out briefly in a cylindrical tower of a downtown hotel, next to a fourteen-year-old slum dweller who struggles for breath as his asthma attack subsides.<br>When I first arrived in Atlanta and all of this was new to me, I took my wife, Yolanda, through the Grady ER on a Friday night.<br>&#x201c;Oh, the humanity,&#x201d; she said.<br>Yolanda, a lawyer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, feels happier above the Mason-Dixon Line.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>TAMMIE Quest&#x2014;I use her real name&#x2014;is cute, has a broad, infectious smile, and comes from privilege. She grew up in Southern California and frequently refers to herself as a &#x201c;black Valley girl.&#x201d;<br>Though she identifies with the West Coast, a lot of Atlanta has rubbed off on her in the Grady ER.<br>No two ERs are alike. Ours tells the story of Atlanta more clearly, more poignantly than its skyline. Patients everywhere are scared of their wounds or diseases that rage inside them. Here, in the middle of this big, hot, loud, violent city, they have an added fear: they are terrified of each other, often with good cause.<br>Elsewhere, patients might trust us doctors, admire us, even bow to our robes, our honorifics, and the all-caps abbreviations that follow our names. Here, not so much.<br>A place called Tuskegee is about two hours away from here. It&#x2019;s where government doctors staged a medical experiment in the thirties: they watched black men die of syphilis, withholding treatment even after effective drugs were invented.<br>Tuskegee is not an abstraction in these parts. It&#x2019;s a physical place, as palpable as a big, deep wound, and eighty-plus years don&#x2019;t mean a thing. Tuskegee is a huge, flashing CAUTION sign in the consciousness of Southern black folks. It explains why they don&#x2019;t trust doctors much and why good docs such as Tammie have to fight so hard to earn their elementary trust.<br>Like me, Tammie is a member of the medical-school faculty at Emory University, and, like me, she has several academic interests. One of these interests is end-of-life care for cancer patients: controlling the symptoms when someone with advanced cancer shows up in your ER.<br>Seeing us approach, she walks toward us and hands me a wooden clipboard with the Grady forms. I look at her face, gauging the mixture of sadness, moral outrage, and fatigue.<br>She says something like &#x201c;This patient <i>needs</i> someone who cares,&#x201d; and disappears.<br>I glance at the chief complaint.<br>&#x201c;Holy shit,&#x201d; I say to Bill Bernstein and, more so, to myself.<br>I introduce myself to a trim, middle-aged, black woman, not unattractive, wearing a blue examination gown conspicuously stamped GRADY. (At Grady, things such as gowns, infusion pumps, and money tend to vanish.)<br>From the moment Tammie paged me, I knew that the situation had to be more than a run-of-the-mill emergency. This patient clearly is not about to die on the examination table. She doesn&#x2019;t need emergency treatment. Before anything, she needs somebody to talk to. She needs attention, both medical and human.<br>The patient, Edna Riggs, is fifty-three. She works for the phone company and lives on the southeast side of Atlanta.<br>Sitting on an exam table, she looks placid. When she extends her hand, it feels limp. She makes fleeting eye contact. This is depression, maybe. Shame does the same thing, as does a sense of doom. <i>Fatalism</i> is the word doctors have repurposed to describe this last form of alienation.<br>In medicine, we speak a language of our own, and Edna&#x2019;s physical problem has a name in doctorese: automastectomy.

Now she tells us what to actually do about it.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> While the best way to deal with a sociopath is to avoid them entirely, sometimes circumstance doesn't allow for that. What happens when the time comes to defend yourself against your own child, a boss, or ruthless ex-spouse? Inspired by the many chilling and often heartbreaking emails and letters she has received over the years, Dr. Martha Stout uncovers the psychology behind the sociopath's methods and provides concrete guidelines to help navigate these dangerous interactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Organized around categories such as destructive narcissism, violent sociopaths, sociopathic coworkers, and the sociopath in your family, <i>Outsmarting the Sociopath Next Door</i> contains detailed explanation and commentary on how best to react in these situations to keep the sociopath at bay. Uniting these categories is a discussion of changing psychological theories of personality and sociopathy and the enduring triumph of conscience over those who operate without empathy or concern for others. By understanding the person you're dealing with and changing the rules of the game, you'll be able to gain the upper hand and escape the sociopath's influence. <br> &nbsp;<br> Whether you're fighting a custody battle against a sociopathic ex or being gaslighted by a boss or coworker, you'll find hope and help within these pages. With this guide to disarming the conscienceless, Dr. Stout aims to give readers the tools to protect themselves while conducting a broader examination of human behavior and conceptions of normality.</p><p>Martha Stout, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist in private practice, served on the faculty in psychology in the department of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School for twenty-five years.

When the king insists the man accept a reward, the man proposes a deal: He will take a payment of rice equal to each square on the king&#x2019;s chessboard&#x2014;doubling the amount he receives with each day. This quickly empties out the royal coffers. . . . &nbsp;<br><br> A Notable Children&#x2019;s Trade Book in the Field of Social Studies and Outstanding Science Trade Book for Children</p><p>Grade 2-6 The king of the title is an Indian potentate who receives a service from a wiseman and insists on repaying the fa vor. The wiseman finally requests the familiar mathematical puzzle of the chessboard, on whose first square is placed a single grain of rice, on whose second square is placed two grains, four on the third square, and so on. The king, who is too proud to admit that he can't calculate the sum total of the gift, foolishly grants the wish, at least until it becomes clear that it will wipe out his stock. Finally, in spite of his pride, he takes back his repayment, justly em barrassed because of his stupidity and the wiseman's obvious generosity in not wanting a repayment in the first place. The story may be recognizable to older readers familiar with mathemati cal puzzles, but it will be new to begin ning mathematicians and readers. The tale is simply told, and the primitive watercolor pictures, with some bright jewel tones to set off the otherwise an tique cast of the colors, aptly comple ment this original folktale. Although the text is too complicated for begin ners to master on their own, this picture book is so masterfully told that they will listen to it attentively. Ruth K. MacDonald, Department of English, New Mexico State Univ . , Las Cruces<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Here is a tale full of exotic, old-world flavor which takes place at a palace in ancient India. Detailed drawings show a fortress made of tall minarets and spires, heralds astride decorated elephants, servants bearing shields, and a turbaned ruler bedecked in rich jewels. The story itself is a parable about a powerful king and a wise man whose simple requesta grain of rice doubled for each square of the king's chessboardproves to be an impossible challenge for the royal granary. A amusing scenario unfolds as the amount of rice multiplies daily, causing great curiosity among the villagers and embarrassment to the prideful king, who learns a valuable lesson.

His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first <em>Peanuts</em> daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.<br><br> Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from <em>Peanuts</em> at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.</p><p>Director, screenwriter, and well-known raconteur of American kitsch and camp, <b>John Waters</b>' films include <i>Pink Flamingos</i> and <i>Cecil B.

Andrea is really Virginia Dare, from the Lost Colony of Roanoke. Jonah and Katherine are confident in their ability to help Andrea fix history, but when their journey goes dangerously awry, they realize that they may be in over their head. They&#39;ve landed in the wrong time period. Andrea doesn&#39;t seem that interested in leaving the past. And even worse, it appears that someone has deliberately sabotaged their mission...</p><p>Margaret Peterson Haddix is the author of many critically and popularly acclaimed YA and middle grade novels, including the Children of Exile series, The Missing series, the Under Their Skin series, and the Shadow Children series.

In another mood, Jonah would have been fascinated by this&#x2014;how was the chair programmed? Did it have a computer chip making it squirm? But right now Jonah was too distracted. He was sitting in a sterile, nearly empty room, waiting to travel back in time to an unknown era and unknown dangers. So all he could do was fidget.<br><br><i>You&#x2019;d think, with time travel, there wouldn&#x2019;t have to be any waiting,</i> he thought grumpily.<br><br>Beside him, his eleven-year-old sister, Katherine, bounced in her chair&#x2014;making the chair bounce too&#x2014;and chattered away to Andrea, the third kid who would be going to the past with them. Indeed, Andrea was the most important time traveler that day. She was the reason they were all going.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; Katherine told Andrea. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to hold your breath or anything to travel through time. It&#x2019;s easy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; Andrea said softly. She sat perfectly still, and so did her chair. She had her eyes focused on the blank wall across from her and barely seemed to be paying attention to Katherine. Normally Jonah would have approved of that&#x2014;he tried to ignore his younger sister as much as possible too. But unlike Katherine and Jonah, Andrea had never traveled to the past before. She didn&#x2019;t know what time period she was going to, or what she&#x2019;d have to do there. Shouldn&#x2019;t she be asking questions? Shouldn&#x2019;t she at least act like she cared?<br><br>&#x201c;Only, if you get time sick, that&#x2019;s no fun,&#x201d; Katherine rambled on, flipping her blond ponytail over her shoulder. &#x201c;When we went back to 1483 with Chip and Alex, I thought I was going to throw up for sure. And I felt really dizzy, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Katherine!&#x201d; Jonah interrupted, because he could put up with Katherine&#x2019;s babbling for only so long. &#x201c;Andrea won&#x2019;t get time sick like you did. Remember? She&#x2019;s going back to her proper time. Where she belongs. So she&#x2019;ll feel good.&#x201d;<br><br>At that, Andrea&#x2019;s whole face brightened.<br><br><i>Wow,</i> Jonah thought. <i>She&#x2019;s really pretty</i>. He honestly hadn&#x2019;t noticed before. Of course, he barely knew Andrea. The first time he&#x2019;d met her, there&#x2019;d been thirty-four other kids around, and four grown-ups fighting about what was going to happen to the kids, and people being Tasered and tied up and zapped back in time . . . Jonah had had a good excuse for not looking closely. All he remembered from that first meeting was that Andrea had worn her long brown hair in two braids, and she hadn&#x2019;t screamed and panicked like a lot of the other kids. And he guessed he knew that&#x2014;like him and the other kids the grown-ups were fighting over&#x2014;Andrea was thirteen years old, and she was a missing child from history, one who had been stolen from her proper time and place by baby smugglers. One who had to go back, to save history.<br><br>Suddenly Jonah really wanted to remind Andrea that he and Katherine had already proved that they could save history <i>and</i> save missing kids, all at once, even when the time experts thought it was impossible. They&#x2019;d managed to save Chip and Alex from the 1480s, hadn&#x2019;t they? Jonah started to smile back at Andrea and was working up what he wanted to say to her: something suave but casual and not too conceited-sounding . . . . Did, <i>Don&#x2019;t be scared. I&#x2019;ll take care of you</i> sound stupid?<br><br>Katherine began talking again before Jonah had a chance to say anything.<br><br>&#x201c;Andrea can too get time sick,&#x201d; Katherine argued. &#x201c;Not the kind from being in the wrong time period, but the kind just from traveling through time. Remember JB thought I had both kinds? And that&#x2019;s why I felt so awful? And . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Katherine broke off because the door opened just then and JB, the very person she&#x2019;d been talking about, stepped through.<br><br>JB was a time traveler from the future, and the main person who was trying to fix time by returning all the stolen kids to history. Tall, with gleaming chestnut-brown hair, JB was so good-looking that Katherine had nicknamed him cute janitor boy before any of them had found out what he really did for a living. For some reason, JB&#x2019;s appearance really annoyed Jonah right now. Depending on how you looked at it, Jonah had known JB for only a few weeks&#x2014;or for more than five hundred years. (Or, actually, more than a thousand, if you counted the fact that Jonah, Katherine, Chip, and Alex had traveled between the fifteenth and twenty-first centuries in <i>both</i> directions.) Regardless, it had taken Jonah a while to figure out whether to trust JB or not. JB had helped Jonah and Katherine and their friends, but Jonah still wasn&#x2019;t sure: If JB had to choose between saving kids and saving history, which would he pick?<br><br><i>I have to make sure that isn&#x2019;t the choice</i>,<i></i> Jonah told himself grimly. He gazed over at Andrea again, with her clear pale skin and her gray eyes that somehow looked sad again&#x2014;haunted, even. <i>I</i> will <i>protect you</i>,<i></i> he thought, even though he figured he&#x2019;d really sound foolish if he said that now. He kicked his foot against the ground, and his chair kicked too.<br><br>&#x201c;Careful,&#x201d; JB warned. &#x201c;Those are calibrated to a very sensitive level.&#x201d; He seemed to notice Katherine&#x2019;s bouncing for the first time. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not really meant for kids.&#x201d;<br><br>Katherine stopped mid-bounce. Her chair rose up and caught her.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Katherine said. &#x201c;Can we go now? There&#x2019;s no chance that we&#x2019;ll hurt your precious chairs if you just send us to the past.&#x201d;<br><br>She sounded offended. Jonah wondered if he should warn JB that it wasn&#x2019;t a good idea to offend Katherine.<br><br>&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; JB said. &#x201c;You need to be debriefed first.&#x201d;<br><br>Katherine leaned forward in her chair, and her chair leaned with her.<br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; she breathed, seeming to forget any hurt feelings. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll tell us where we&#x2019;re going this time&#x2014;before we get there?&#x201d;<br><br>JB laughed.<br><br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t give me much of a chance the last time,&#x201d; he reminded her.<br><br>&#x201c;That wasn&#x2019;t our fault,&#x201d; Jonah argued hotly. &#x201c;If you hadn&#x2019;t sent Chip and Alex back without telling them anything, and if you hadn&#x2019;t cheated when I gave you the Elucidator, and if&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>JB held up his hand, cutting Jonah off.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, hey,&#x201d; JB said. &#x201c;Calm down. I&#x2019;m sorry, okay? That&#x2019;s over and done with. Water under the bridge. Haven&#x2019;t you ever heard the expression, &#x2018;No need to relive the past&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br>Katherine and Jonah both stared at him blankly.<br><br>&#x201c;Um, isn&#x2019;t it kind of, uh, contradictory, for a time traveler to say that?&#x201d; Katherine asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d; JB beamed at them. &#x201c;You caught the irony. Time-traveler humor&#x2014;gotta love it.&#x201d;<br><br>He turned toward Andrea, who was still sitting quietly, unaffected.<br><br>&#x201c;As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, we&#x2019;re all on the same team this time around,&#x201d; JB said. &#x201c;From the very beginning. No keeping secrets unnecessarily. Deal?&#x201d; He held out his hand to Andrea.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Andrea said calmly. She shook JB&#x2019;s hand, before he moved on to shake Jonah&#x2019;s and Katherine&#x2019;s in turn. Maybe if Jonah hadn&#x2019;t been paying such close attention to Andrea now, he wouldn&#x2019;t have noticed that Andrea hesitated slightly before speaking, before taking JB&#x2019;s hand.<br><br><i>She</i> is<i> scared</i>,<i></i> Jonah thought. <i>She really does need me to take care of her.</i><br><br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;ll tell Andrea who she really is?&#x201d; Katherine asked eagerly.<br><br><i>And me?</i> Jonah almost asked, forgetting that he was supposed to be all about protecting Andrea at the moment. Jonah had seen his two friends Chip and Alex learn their original identities in history. And he knew that, ultimately, he would have to return to his original time period, at least briefly&#x2014;just like all the other missing kids from history. But, as much as he wanted to know his own identity and his own time period . . . maybe he wasn&#x2019;t quite ready to know right now?<br><br>The moment when he could have asked was past. JB was answering Katherine.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought I&#x2019;d just show her,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>JB flipped a switch on the wall behind Jonah&#x2019;s chair, and the wall opposite them instantly turned into what appeared to be an incredibly high-definition TV screen. Waves crashed against a sandy beach, and Jonah had no doubt that, if he looked carefully enough, he&#x2019;d be able to make out each individual grain of sand.<br><br>&#x201c;Just skip to the part she&#x2019;s going to be interested in,&#x201d; JB said.<br><br>Jonah wasn&#x2019;t sure if JB was talking directly to the TV screen (or whatever futuristic invention it actually was) or if there was someone in a control room somewhere who was monitoring their entire conversation. Sometimes Jonah just didn&#x2019;t want to think too much about the whole time-travel mess. He knew that JB had already pulled them out of the twenty-first century, and the waiting room they were in was a &#x201c;time hollow,&#x201d; a place where time didn&#x2019;t really exist. He knew that JB was probably about to show them some scene from Andrea&#x2019;s &#x201c;real&#x201d; life, before she&#x2019;d been kidnapped by unethical time travelers, and before she&#x2019;d crash-landed (with all the other missing kids) at the very end of the twentieth century. But it made Jonah feel better if he told himself he was just watching a TV with really, really good reception.<br><br>The scene before him shifted, seeming to fly across the water to a marshy coastline and then inland a bit to a primitive-looking cluster of houses. Some of the houses were encircled by a wooden fence that was maybe eight or nine feet tall. Both the houses and the fence looked a bit ramshackle, with holes in several spots.<br><br>The view shifted again, focusing on a woman rushing out of one of the nicer houses. The woman was wearing what Jonah thought of as old-fashioned clothes: a long skirt, long sleeves, and a funny-looking hat covering her head. The skirt wasn&#x2019;t quite as sweeping as the ones he&#x2019;d seen in the fifteenth century, but Jonah wasn&#x2019;t sure if that meant that he was looking at a different time period now, or if he was just watching different people. Poorer ones. Not royalty anymore.<br><br>&#x201c;Mistress Dare&#x2019;s baby has arrived!&#x201d; the woman called, joy overtaking the exhaustion in her face. &#x201c;A wee girl child, strong and fair!&#x201d;<br><br>Other people began rushing out of the other houses, cheering and calling out, &#x201c;Huzzah, huzzah!&#x201d; But Jonah got only a brief glimpse of them before the camera&#x2014;or whatever perspective he was watching&#x2014;zoomed in tighter. Through the door, across a clay floor, up to a bed . . . On the bed a woman hugged a tiny baby against her chest.<br><br>&#x201c;My dearest girl,&#x201d; the woman whispered, her face glowing with love, even in the dim candlelight. &#x201c;My little Virginia.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;NO!&#x201d; someone screamed.<br><br>It took Jonah a moment to realize that the screaming hadn&#x2019;t come from the scene before him. He peered around, annoyed that Katherine would interrupt like that. But Katherine, beside him, was gazing around in befuddlement too.<br><br>It was Andrea&#x2014;quiet, calm, unperturbed Andrea&#x2014;who had her mouth open, who was even now jumping to her feet, eyes blazing with fury.<br><br>&#x201c;NO!&#x201d; she screamed again. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not me! That&#x2019;s not my mother!&#x201d;<br><br>� 2010 Margaret Peterson Haddix</p><h2>Cool, Calm, and Confident: A Workbook to Help Kids Learn Assertiveness Skills</h2><p><p><strong>Self-assured, assertive kids are not only less likely to be picked on by their peers, they're also less likely to bully others.</strong> But it's not always easy for children to find a healthy middle ground between passivity and aggression.<br><br>If your child is a frequent target for bullies, or has begun to tease and take advantage of other kids, the easy and effective activities in <em>Cool, Calm, and Confident</em> can help.

He had never believed that sitting out in the open waiting to meet the dawn and have the sun fry him was an act of nobility. He-and a very few others-had always believed it to be an act of cowardice. Yet here he was, deliberating whether or not to give himself permission to die. The sun wasn't close, but the wounds he'd sustained battling so many vampires at one time had weakened him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With the loss of blood, and several near-fatal wounds, the human vampire hunters hadn't recognized him as a hunter and had attacked while he'd left his body an empty shell so he could try to heal those wounds. A stake close to the heart-they'd missed-hadn't felt so good. They really weren't very good at their self-appointed task. They'd torn open his chest, and more blood had spilled onto the battleground. He'd never thought he'd die in a country far from home-killed by a trio of bumbling humans-but dying seemed a good alternative to continuing a life of battle in an endless gray void.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The three men, Carter, Barnaby and Shorty, huddled together a distance from him, casting him terrified and hate-filled glances. They were trying to convince themselves they'd done it right and he was dying. Of course, they'd expected him to die immediately and now wondered why he hadn't and what they should do about it. He could have told them they'd need another stake and a much better impaling technique if they wanted him to die. Did he really have to instruct others on how to kill him? That was ridiculous.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sighing, he tried weighing the pros and cons of dying in order to make a rational decision. He'd lived too long. Far too long. He'd killed too often-so much so that there was little left of his soul. He'd lived with honor, but there had to be a time when one could let go with honor. It was past his time. He'd known that for well over a century. He'd searched the world over for his lifemate, the woman holding the other half of his soul, the light to his darkness. She didn't exist. It was that simple. She didn't exist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Carpathian males lost all emotion and the ability to see in color after two hundred years. Some lost it earlier. They had to exist on memories, and after so many centuries, even those faded. They retained their battle skills-honed them nightly-but as time passed, all those long, endless years, even the memories of family and friends faded away. He lived his life far from humans most of the time, working in the night to keep them safe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vampires were Carpathians who had given up their honor in order to feel again. There was a rush when one killed while feeding. Adrenaline-laced blood could produce a high. Vampires craved it, and they terrorized their victims before killing them. Andor had hunted them on nearly every continent. As time passed, the centuries coming and going, the whispers of temptation to turn increased. For a few hundred years, those whispers sustained him, even if he knew the promise was empty. Eventually, even that was lost to him. Then he lived in a gray world of . . . nothing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He had entered the monastery high in the remote Carpathian Mountains, a place where a very few ancients had locked themselves away from the world when they'd been deemed too dangerous to hunt and kill but didn't believe in giving themselves to the dawn. Every kill increased the danger of turning, and he had lived too long, knew too much to be vampire. Few hunters would ever be able to defeat him, yet here he was, nearly done in by a trio of inept, bumbling human assassins.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He had taken the vow to be honorable in waiting for his lifemate with the other ancients. Of course, the situation had been made worse by secreting themselves in a place where there was no hope of each finding the one woman who could restore emotions and color to their lives-but they had known that. They had accepted the truth: their women were no longer in the same world with them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The whispers of his would-be killers grew annoying. Really annoying. His head was swimming, making it difficult to think. He lay looking up at the sky. Stars were out, but they appeared as blurred lights, nothing more. Their light was a dull gray, just as the moon was. He looked down at the blood seeping out of his body, pooling around him from more than a dozen wounds-and that didn't count the stake. The blood was a darker gray. An ugly mess. How had he gotten here, so far from his homeland and the monastery where he'd placed himself so he wouldn't give in to the nothingness that surrounded him?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hope had come to the monks, so they'd scattered, looking once again for the women who might save their souls. When they'd realized the world was too changed and too vast and once more they didn't fit and there was little hope, they'd answered the call of their fellow monk and followed him to the United States. The vampires had grown powerful, and Carpathians were behind in the ways of the new world. It had been an effort to catch up when before he had always found it easy to learn newer, more modern things. That had led him to this moment-considering that he'd outlived his time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everything was different. He was forced to live in close proximity to humans and to hide who and what he was. Women were different. They no longer were satisfied having a man care for them. He had no idea what to do with a modern woman. Contemplating his demise seemed so much wiser than trying to understand the reasoning of a present-day woman.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was difficult to think, although the night was beautiful. The humans kept talking, whispering together, sending anxious looks his way. He wanted them to be quiet and considered silencing them so he could continue to contemplate, but it was finally dawning on them that maybe they should have studied anatomy a little better before deciding on their profession.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Carter ended up drawing the short straw. The others sent him over to figure out what had gone wrong. He was shaking, trembling from head to foot as he approached, clearly terrified of the man they had tried to murder. Sweat poured off the assassin, and he wiped it away with the back of his hand as he drew near.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He loomed over Andor, the stink of fanaticism reeking from his pores, his features twisted into a mask of hatred and determination. Andor wasn't quite ready to make up his mind about death. He lifted his hand to push enough air at the man to send him flying backward when a woman rushed out of the darkness and attacked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The moon was full, scattering beams of light over the battleground. There was no evidence of the vampires he'd killed because he'd disposed of them properly. He wasn't getting a minute of peace any time soon, not even with a stake sticking out of him and his blood everywhere, not with his supposed savior in the form of a little whirlwind of fury attacking his three would-be assassins. He was going to have to rescue her. That meant living longer. He didn't like having his mind made up for him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She moved with incredible speed, an avenging angel, her long hair flying, her hiking boots crunching rock, dirt and the lightning-scorched grass beneath her feet. She bashed Carter with what appeared to be a saucepot, whirling like a tornado and striking him again. She went under his punch, blocking it upward with one arm: it sounded as if it must have felt like a blow as she clobbered him right in the face with the pot. Carter staggered backward and then hit the ground.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Andor closed his eyes briefly, thinking perhaps he was seeing an illusion. What woman would attack three men with a saucepot when they'd just staked someone? He sighed again and thought about how much blood he was going to lose when he sat up and yanked out the stake. It would leave a good-sized hole in his chest. On the other hand, he could leave it in . . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Don't you move," she hissed, not looking at him, but one slender hand came back behind her, palm toward him in the universal signal to stop.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He went still. Utterly still. Frozen. His lungs felt raw, burning for air. It wasn't possible. It couldn't be. More than a thousand years. An endless void. His eyes hurt so badly he had to close them, a dangerous thing to do when she was certain to be attacked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The other two men hadn't the courage of Carter and had backed away a distance from him, just in case when Carter did whatever he was considering to remedy the situation-in other words, trying to kill Andor again-they thought themselves safe. Both men might not want anything to do with the big man on the ground, but a woman armed with a saucepot was an entirely different matter. They had separated and circled around, edging up on either side of her while she had been busy smacking Carter with the pot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What is wrong with you people?" She was furious, emphasizing each word with a bang of the pot on Carter. "Are you crazy? That's a human being you're murdering."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Andor had been lying in a puddle of his own blood, contemplating death, surrounded by a gray world. Everything had been gray, or shades of it. The ground. The blood. The trees. The moon overhead. Even his three would-be assassins. He had felt no real emotion, detached and completely removed from what had been happening to him. The world changed in the blink of an eye. His burning eyes, his lungs that refused to obey his commands. Everything so raw he could barely comprehend what was happening.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Color burst behind his eyes. Vivid. Brilliant. Terrible. In spite of the night, he could see the green in the trees and the shrubs, varying shades. His blood appeared red, a bright shade of crimson. He made out colors on the three men, blues and true blacks. The moon caught the woman right in its spotlight, the beams illuminating her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Andor's breath caught in his throat. Her hair was the color of chestnuts, dark brown with reddish and golden undertones making the thick mass gleam in the moonbeams. Her eyes were large and very green, and she had a mouth that he could fixate on when he'd never obsessed or fixated on anything in his very long existence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The vivid colors were disorienting when he already was in a weakened state. His stomach knotted. Churned. He felt as if he had vertigo. He needed to sit up. To protect her. The colors flashed through his mind, swirling into a nightmare of soundless chaos. At the same time, emotions poured in, feelings he couldn't sort through fast enough to make sense of or process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Carter was on the ground cowering as Shorty reached for the woman. She whirled around and bonked him over the head. "Do you have any idea how hard it is for me to meditate when you're murdering someone?" She glared at Andor over her shoulder. "And you. Lying there, deciding whether or not you've had enough of life? What is wrong with you? Life is to be cherished. Not thrown away."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Shorty tried another misguided attempt to punch her. She hit his hand with the pot so hard even Andor winced at the sound. Shorty howled and stepped back, regarding her warily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm on a journey seeking personal enlightenment, and you are disturbing my aura of love." The pot hit Barnaby on his shoulder hard enough that he covered his head and turned sideways to avoid another swipe. He'd made the mistake of trying to sneak up on her from the other side.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm on a path of nonviolence so that my life can be an example to the world of what it would be like living in a better place. Peace . . ." She smashed the pot against the side of Barnaby's head as he went at her again and then kicked the side of his knee hard enough to send him to the ground. "Love." She turned toward Shorty and began to advance on him menacingly. "Embracing nature."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Shorty grinned at her and shook his head. "You're a nut."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Maybe, but you're a murderer." She ducked a punch, blocking it smoothly with the pot and bashing his arm while she stepped in and punched his jaw. Hard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Andor could see Shorty's head snap back. She had quite a punch, but he was going to have to do something before the murderous pack got serious about going after his woman. He forced his body to move. It wasn't easy with a stake protruding from his chest, right beneath his heart. When he moved, blood leaked out around the wood. It hurt like hell and he had to cut off his ability to feel pain if he was going to actually move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Don't," she hissed out at him, a clear command. Annoyed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No one in his lifetime had ever used a tone like that on him. He gave the orders, not a woman, and certainly not a human. Worse-a human woman.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Don't you move. I'll get to you in a minute." She turned her head to look at him over her shoulder, and her eyes widened in horror. "Oh. My. God." Her saucepot lowered and she half turned toward him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He waved his hand toward Shorty, who was coming up behind her fast. Shorty stumbled and fell, almost at her feet, drawing her attention. She smashed the pot over his head. She became a little fury, rushing Barnaby again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Why would you do that to another human being?" There was a little sob in her voice, as if just seeing the cruelty of the stake in Andor's chest hurt her as well. "I'm supposed to be learning to live without anger and you're torturing and brutally murdering another man. How can I possibly be okay with that? If this is some kind of test, I'm failing. You're making me fail." She kicked Barnaby in the chest, hard. Her forward snap kick was powerful and sent the assassin flying back so far, he hit a tree and slid to the ground.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"He's not human!" Carter shouted. "That's a vampire!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She stopped in her tracks. "You're all crazy. He's a man." For the first time wariness had crept in.</p></p><h2>Heaven Misplaced: Christ&#39;s Kingdom on Earth</h2><p>Though most Christians refrain from predicting exactly when our world will end, many believe that when earth's finale does arrive, it will be a catastrophe. They expect that before Christ comes back to reclaim His own, Satan will escape his chains and return to wreak havoc on our planet. Details vary, but the general assumption is the same: things will get much, much worse before they get better. <p></p><p>But is this really what the Bible teaches? </p><p></p><p>Leaving aside the theological terms that often confuse and muddle this question, Douglas Wilson instead explains eschatology as the end of the greatest story in the world-the story of mankind. He turns our attention back to the stories and prophecies of Scripture and argues for "hopeful optimism": the belief that God will be true to His promises, that His will shall be done on earth as it is in heaven, and that the peace and good will we sing about at Christmas will one day be a reality here on earth.</p></p><p>Douglas Wilson is the pastor of Christ Church, Moscow, Idaho, and editor of <i>Credenda/Agenda</i> magazine. He is the author of many books, including <i>Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning, Reforming Marriage,</i> and <i>A Primer on Worship and Reformation.</i> He is also co-author with Christopher Hitchens of <i>Is Christianity Good for the World?</i> He and his wife Nancy have three children and fifteen grandchildren.</p><h2>Temple Grandin: How the Girl Who Loved Cows Embraced Autism and Changed the World</h2><p><p>When Temple Grandin was born, her parents knew she was different.

Today Aaron Burr is remembered more for the fatal duel that killed rival Alexander Hamilton. But long before that single shot destroyed Burr&#x2019;s political career, there were other dark whispers about him: that he was untrustworthy, a libertine, a man unafraid of claiming whatever he believed should be his.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sold into slavery as a child in India, Mary Emmons was brought to an America torn by war. Toughened by the experiences of her young life, Mary is intelligent, resourceful, and strong. She quickly gains the trust of her new mistress, Theodosia Prevost, and becomes indispensable in a complicated household filled with intrigue&#x2014;especially when the now-widowed Theodosia marries Colonel Aaron Burr. As Theodosia sickens with the fatal disease that will finally kill her, Mary and Burr are drawn together into a private world of power and passion, and a secret, tangled union that would have shocked the nation . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for <i>I, Eliza Hamilton</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&#x201c;Scott&#x2019;s devotion to research is evident . . . a rewarding take on a fascinating historical couple.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br>&#x2014;<i>Library Journal&nbsp;</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&#x201c;Readers will be captivated.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly&nbsp;</i>(starred review)</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&#x201c;Packed with political and historical as well as domestic details.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i></b></p><p><b>Susan Holloway Scott</b> is the author of over fifty historical novels.

But her investigation turns far more dangerous when she realizes the victim&#x2019;s skin is covered in an unusual rash&#x2014;and Scarpetta herself may have just been exposed to a deadly virus.</p><p>Virginia Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta has a bloody puzzle on her hands: five headless, limbless cadavers in Ireland, plus four similar victims in a landfill back home. Is a serial butcher loose in Virginia? That's what the panicked public thinks, thanks to a local TV reporter who got the leaked news from her boyfriend, Scarpetta's vile rival, Investigator Percy Ring. But the butchered bodies are so many red herrings intended to throw idiots like Ring off the track. Instead of a run-of-the-mill serial killer, we're dealing with a shadowy figure who has plans involving mutant smallpox, mass murder, and messing with Scarpetta's mind by e-mailing her gory photos of the murder scenes, along with cryptic AOL chat-room messages. The coolest innovation: Scarpetta's gorgeous genius niece, Lucy, equips her with a DataGlove and a VPL Eyephone, and she takes a creepy virtual tour of the e-mailed crime scene. <p> <i>Unnatural Exposure</i> boasts brisk storytelling, crackling dialogue, evocative prose about forensic-science sleuthing, and crisp character sketches, both of familiar characters like Scarpetta's gruff partner Pete Marino and bit players like the landfill employee falsely accused by Ring. Plus, let's face it: serial killers are old hat. Cornwell's most vivid villains are highly plausible backstabbing colleagues like Ring, who plots to destroy Lucy's FBI career by outing her as a lesbian. Some readers object to the rather abrupt ending, but, hey, it's less jarring than <i>Hannibal</i>'s, and it's the logical culmination of Cornwell's philosophy about human nature. To illuminate the novel's finale, read Cornwell's remarks on paranoia in her Amazon.com interview. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>"In this return to the luridly fascinating world of Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Cornwell delivers the goods."<br>--Publishers Weekly<br><br>When the body of an elderly woman is found dismembered in a Virginia landfill, forensic pathologist Kay Scarpetta initially believes that the clues mirror that of a serial killer she's encountered before. But upon further investigation she discovers puzzling pox-like eruptions on the woman's body that, perhaps, point in another direction.<br><br>The killer then contacts Scarpetta via e-mail, and she enlists the aid of her computer-savvy niece, Lucy, to help track this monster through cyberspace. When Scarpetta learns that the Virginia victim was exposed to a high-tech virus that might unleash an epidemic, she begins to realize that she's dealing with a sophisticated and devious mind.<br><br>Her investigation leads her to the government's biological defense facility in Utah and to Atlanta's Center for Disease Control--and eventually to quarantine, when it's discovered that Scarpetta has been exposed to this often fatal virus. Along the way, she's forced to deal with the unscrupulous ambitions of a slick FBI agent, Lucy's problems, and her own turbulent feelings for Agent Wesley Benton.<br><br>Taut with unrelieved tension and continual surprises, <b>Unnatural Exposure</b> is the case of Kay Scarpetta's life--and a triumph for Patricia Cornwell.</p><h2>The Jersey Shore Cookbook: Fresh Summer Flavors from the Boardwalk and Beyond</h2><p><b>Coastal cuisine from Asbury Park to Cape May, with 50 recipes from your favorite beachside restaurants and farm-fresh New Jersey ingredients for a perfect taste of summer.</b><br><br>The warm sand.

For almost a decade, he has chronicled his incompetence on the back page of <i>Field &amp; Stream</i>, where his hilarious dispatches about life as a hapless outdoorsman who lives in suburbia have earned him legions of fans. But Heavey is more than a humorist. The stories in this book range from amusing tales of a modern dad struggling to navigate the finer points of parenting and married life to longer and more serious narratives that involve travel, adventure, and tragedy. No matter what he&#x2019;s writing about, Heavey is a master of blending humor and pathos and wide-ranging outdoor enthusiasms into a poignant and potent stew.<br></p><p>From <i>The Baltimore Sun</i>, December 23, 2007 <br><br> Shticks, stones, funny bones <br><br> Candus Thomson <br><br> Bill Heavey's humor columns make dandy bookmarks. <br><br> That's a compliment. <br><br> For a number of years, I have been carefully tearing the back page out of Field and Stream, underlining his best lines and archiving them in travel books, cookbooks and the latest best-seller that resides in my personal library on the toilet tank. <br><br> This is my way of acknowledging both his writing skill and the fact that my alma mater, Emerson College (sadly named for Charles Wesley, the carnival barker, not Ralph Waldo, the essayist), will never dedicate a Thomson wing in the campus library filled with my papers. <br><br> But magazine pages get old and frayed. And when the Charmin runs out, you'd better believe all bets are off. <br><br> Luckily, Field and Stream has seen fit to bundle some of Heavey's best work into a single volume, If You Didn't Bring Jerky, What Did I Just Eat? (Atlantic Monthly Press, $23). <br><br> Heavey, a Northern Virginia resident who claims Maryland's woods and waters as his home turf, is just as funny in hardcover as he is stuffed in a book on the back of the American Standard. <br><br> If you're a regular reader, you know Heavey claims no extraordinary talents to make him the alpha outdoorsman. He writes: "I am physically unimpressive, have the woods sense of a parking meter and for years thought that a 'staging area' was where deer rehearsed theatrical performances." <br><br> It's a shtick that works. If you fish or hunt, you will embrace a lot of Heavey's takes on the outdoors and laugh at some of the stuff he does. For example: <br><br> * On finding his daughter Emma's SpongeBob Squarepants book in his hunting backpack while in a tree stand: "After not even seeing a deer all morning, and with nothing to lose, I pushed the button decorated with a giggling SpongeBob. Out came a sound like a doe bleat on helium. Intrigued, I hit it again. A doe emerged from the bushes 70 yards distant, where it stood alert and frozen for two minutes. I hit the button once more. Fifteen minutes later, I sent an arrow into that deer. I am unsure about SpongeBob's sexual orientation, but I will say this: The boy knows deer." <br><br> * On bass fishing TV shows: "Many television hosts like to kiss the bass they catch. I don't know who started this, but it has become epidemic. And it has to be hurting the catch-and-release survival rate. How strong do you think your will to live would be if the last thing you saw before being set free was an extreme close-up of [professional angler] Woo Daves' lips?" <br><br> * On spinning rod vs. fly rod: "My idea of fun is catching fish. Tons of them if possible. I love the tug and the way all three of us - the fish, the line, and I - become electrically connected for a few moments. I can count on zero fingers the number of times I've gone to bed thinking, 'That would have been a pretty good day if I hadn't caught so many fish.' But you can't tell a fly fisherman that. He'll give you some mumbo jumbo about 'loving the process,' spit white wine in your eye, and run you over with his Saab." <br><br> * On bow hunting in January: "The strange fact is that I like the late season, cold and all. I like it because the smart hunters - those smug guys diligent enough to scout the preseason and disciplined enough to avoid over-hunting prime stands - have tagged out. That leaves the woods to guys like me: the obsessed, the unhinged, the ones who don't know when to quit. There is a strange satisfaction in this kind of hunting. If you get a deer, the victory is that much sweeter. If not, it sure wasn't for lack of trying." <br><br> * On the agony of waiting at Fletcher's Boathouse in D.C. for the water to warm enough for fishing: "It would be easier all around if fish lived in the air. Air's a pushover. You throw it a little sunlight and it snuggles into your arms and coos, 'My place or yours?' Even soil heats up fairly fast. A single warm day like this one has no problem coaxing the daffodils and forsythia into promiscuous behavior they'll regret with tomorrow's cold snap. But water remembers what Mama told her. She requires the prolonged application of warmth before she comes around." <br><br> Heavey, 52, wasn't always in this line of work. Until age 40, he toiled for a construction trade association, "making the world safe for concrete." <br><br> A minor midlife crisis convinced him to shuck a regular paycheck and take the poverty vow of a full-time freelance outdoors writer. A newspaper travel story about smallmouth bass fishing was just the lure for Field and Stream, which brought him in from the cold. <br><br> "The outdoors is just a lens through which I filter everything, and a lot of the stuff, it's everyman kind of stuff about the difficulty of getting out to fish and hunt and be a good dad and husband," he explains while driving to a parent-teacher conference. <br><br> He didn't grow up hunting, but says he learned first to deer hunt and then graduated to bow hunting "to give me something to lie about the other six months of the year." <br><br> Now the challenge is to balance doing and writing. <br><br> "Sometimes, you have to carve out those 10 minutes for a 3,000-word feature and just bear down," he says, laughing. "It's brutal." <br><br> Does Heavey envision a day when he runs out of ways to poke fun at himself? <br><br> "The short answer is no," he says, driving and laughing. "There's not too much competition on the doofus front." <br><br> So, Bill, why should people buy your book? <br><br> "Because I desperately need the money," says Heavey, still laughing. "I've got all my eggs in one basket." <br><br>Praise for If You Didn't Bring Jerky, What Did I Just Eat?:<br><br> <p>"To the list of great Field &amp; Stream essayists--Robert Ruark, Gene Hill, Cory Ford, and Ed Zern--add the name Bill Heavey. His writing is funny, poignant, acerbic and, best of all, always alert to the absurdities of life. This is a book that will be read and re-read for years and probably for generations." --Patrick F. McManus, New York Times best-selling author of The Bear in the Attic and A Fine and Pleasant Misery<br><br> </p><p>"The Nugent family American Dream quality of life campfire is all about the great outdoors and laughter. Bill Heavey is our guide and outfitter for the best of both worlds. His new book delivers wonderful, clever, balls-to-the-wall hysteria celebrating all things fun and frustrating beyond the pavement. When I die, I want Heavey to gut me, stuff me, and deliver my eulogy for one good last laugh. Unfortunately, I will outlive him, laughing all the way. Bill is my favorite writer. That oughtta ruin his already teetering career once and for all." --Ted Nugent<br><br> </p><p>"Oh, Bill Heavey, you've gone and done it now! Just when I thought all the outdoor writers who could bring the feel of the woods to the printed page had all gone to their reward--guys like Ruark, Hemingway, and Babcock--you come along and prove me wrong. Heavey has an incredible talent for taking the stuff of everyday life--the frustrations and snippets of conversation and days when you don't catch a fish or see a deer--and throwing it all back at us with a slant that somehow brings us hope, reassures us we're not alone, and actually makes us grin. He does all of this because he was born to do it. I think God put him here to show us that what seems like just another day is actually a miracle, a once-in-a-lifetime event that we ought to be grateful for even as it slips through our hands." --Will Primos, founder and president of Primos Hunting Calls<br><br> </p><p>"Funny . . . heart-rending . . . sarcastic . . . thrilling . . . and entertaining." --Gary Garth, Louisville (KY) Courier-Journal<br><br> </p><p>Field &amp; Stream readers on Bill Heavey:<br><br> </p><p>"Regular readers know Bill Heavey is one of the best humor writers working today. But with "Dog Years" it is clear he is one of our best writers, period. What a joy it is to see how he uses the language." --Doug Truax, South Boardman, MI<br><br> </p><p>"A sense of humor is one of the most important traits in a good hunter. Yes, it's important to know how to construct a wigwam from toothpicks, but it's more important to laugh. Bill Heavey seems to understand this better than most. His `Path to Enlightenment' was one of the funniest and truest stories I have ever read. Thank you, from a young father who is waiting for the day his daughter is old enough to explore the woods." --Jay Ellsworth, Hilton, NY<br><br> </p><p>"As a mother of three who lives in the 'burbs, I need all the comedy I can get. I fight my boys and husband to be the first to get the magazine so I can flip to the last page. Know that you are promoting good mental health in millions." --Mary Alice Keffer, Beaverton, OR<br><br></p></p><h2>Problems in Plymouth (AIO Imagination Station Books)</h2><p>The Imagination Station Adventures continue!

Enduring for more than 200 years, Luther&#x2019;s movement was then followed by a "revolutionary time of human knowledge." Yet these advances in our thinking had little impact on Christians&#x2019; adherence to doctrine&#x2014;which has led the faith to a critical point once again.</p><p>Bible scholar and Episcopal bishop John Shelby Spong contends that there is mounting pressure among Christians for a radically new kind of Christianity&#x2014;a faith deeply connected to the human experience instead of outdated dogma. To keep Christianity vital, he urges modern Christians to update their faith in light of these advances in our knowledge, and to challenge the rigid and problematic Church teachings that emerged with the Reformation. There is a disconnect, he argues, between the language of traditional worship and the language of the twenty-first century. Bridging this divide requires us to rethink and reformulate our basic understanding of God.</p><p>With its revolutionary resistance to the authority of the Church in the sixteenth century, Spong sees in Luther&#x2019;s movement a model for today&#x2019;s discontented Christians. In fact, the questions they raise resonate with those contemplated by our ancestors. Does the idea of God still have meaning? Can we still follow historic creeds with integrity? Are not such claims as an infallible Pope or an inerrant Bible ridiculous in today&#x2019;s world? </p><p>In <em>Unbelievable</em>, Spong outlines twelve "theses" to help today&#x2019;s believers more deeply contemplate and reshape their faith. As an educator, clergyman, and writer who has devoted his life to his faith, Spong has enlightened Christians and challenged them to explore their beliefs in new and meaningful ways. In this, his final book, he continues that rigorous tradition, once again offering a revisionist approach that strengthens Christianity and secures its relevance for generations to come.</p></p><p><p>John Shelby Spong, the Episcopal Bishop of Newark before his retirement in 2000, has been a visiting lecturer at Harvard and at more than 500 other universities all over the world. His books, which have sold well over a million copies, include <em>Biblical Literalism: A Gentile Heresy; The Fourth Gospel: Tales of a Jewish Mystic; Re-Claiming the Bible for a Non-Religious World; Eternal Life: A New Vision; Jesus for the Non-Religious, The Sins of Scripture, Resurrection: Myth or Reality?; Why Christianity Must Change or Die;</em> and his autobiography, <em>Here I Stand</em>.

The dark night that St John describes is not abandonment by God but special consideration from Him for those who desire to purify and perfect their souls.<br><br> With a soul purified from earthly attachments, we can advance through the much quoted but oft misunderstood dark night of the souls into unity with God. By accepting the desolation and difficulty of this process, the soul cooperates with God and opens itself to receiving and revealing more perfectly God's glory.<br><br> Be not afraid--<i>Dark Night of the Soul</i>, though austere and exacting in its instructions for holy living, is laced with St. John's charity and kindness, his love of all things beautiful and sacred--including you.</p><p>Almost every believer feels forgotten by God sometimes. Even Christ cried out on the cross, "Oh God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" <i>Dark Night of the Soul</i>, a 16th-century mystical text written by the Carmelite monk St. John of the Cross, ranks among Christianity&#x2019;s most helpful answers to this enduring question. In St. John&#x2019;s vision of spiritual life, the pain of separation from God is to be embraced, not avoided. "The dark night is about being fully present in the tender, wounded emptiness of our own souls," explains translator Mirabai Starr--although she grants that modern culture makes such acceptance hard to attain. "We tend to see difficult feelings as a form of illness, which we hope to conquer, cure, and expel. [St. John of the Cross] has a far greater imagination of human life: his goal is not health but union with the divine." Several fine English translations of <i>Dark Night</i> already exist; Starr&#x2019;s, however, is distinguished by its ecumenism. Minimizing the explicit scriptural references of the original text, she makes the treasures of <i>Dark Night</i> more accessible to readers of all religious traditions. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Kessinger Publishing reprints over 1,500 similar titles all available through Amazon.com.</p><h2>The Perfect Edge: The Ultimate Guide to Sharpening for Woodworkers</h2><p><b>Sharp tools work better!</b><br><br>If you've never experienced the pleasure of using a really sharp tool, you're missing one of the real pleasures of woodworking.

Published in 1969, the book was more recently discovered by a Washington family descendant and reissued as <i>Mount Vernon Love Story</i>. Dispelling the widespread belief that although George Washington married Martha Dandridge Custis, he reserved his true love for Sally Carey Fairfax, his best friend's wife, Mary Higgins Clark describes the Washington marriage as one full of tenderness and passion, as a bond between two people who shared their lives -- even the bitter hardship of a winter in Valley Forge -- in every way. In this author's skilled hands, the history, the love, and the man come fully and dramatically alive.</p><p>The #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Mary Higgins Clark has written forty suspense novels, four collections of short stories, a his�torical novel, a memoir, and two children&#x2019;s books. With bestselling author Alafair Burke she writes the Under Suspicion series including <i>The Cinderella Murder</i>, <i>All Dressed in White</i>, <i>The Sleeping Beauty Killer</i>, <i>Every Breath You Take</i>, and <i>You Don&#x2019;t Own Me</i>. With her daughter Carol Higgins Clark, she has coauthored five more suspense novels. More than one hundred million copies of her books are in print in the United States alone. Her books are international bestsellers.<i>March 4, 1797<br><br>11:45 A.M.<br><br>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</i><br><br>It was a windswept, raw March morning and the city looked bleak and dreary as it shivered under the overcast sky. But the man who stood at the window of his study in the large house on Market Street didn't hear the rattling of the wind against the panes or even feel the persistent draft that penetrated between the window frame and sill. He was staring unseeingly into the street.<br><br>In his mind he was hundreds of miles away and just arriving at Mount Vernon. Eagerly he pictured the last few minutes of that journey. The carriage would gather speed as the horses galloped up the winding road. Then they'd round the bend and it would be there...the great house, gleaming and white in the afternoon sun.<br><br>For years he'd looked forward to that homecoming. Several times during severe illness he'd thought that he wouldn't live to enjoy Mount Vernon. But now the hour was at hand. Now he could go home.<br><br>He was a tall man who still carried himself impressively well. When he was twenty-six an Indian chief had exclaimed that he walked straighter than any brave in the tribe. At sixty-five he'd begun to bend forward a little like a giant tree that could no longer resist the battering force of the wind.<br><br>The width of his shoulders was still there, although the shoulders no longer suggested the agile strength that had once made him seem near godlike to an army. The long white hair was caught in a silk net at the nape of his neck. The black velvet suit and pearl-colored vest had become almost a uniform. The days of blues and scarlets were behind him.<br><br>He was so absorbed in his thoughts that he didn't hear the light tap on the study door, nor did he note when the door opened. For a long moment Patsy stood surveying him intently. To her worried eyes he seemed weary and gaunt. But beneath the concern a current of joy rippled and danced through her. Her fears had been groundless! For eight years a persistent instinct had nagged her that something would happen to him...that he wouldn't live to go home with her...but she'd been wrong. Thank the dear, dear God, she'd been wrong.<br><br>She was a short woman. The gently rounded figure that had once made her seem doll-like had thickened into solid matronly lines. Still, she moved with a quick, light step and from under her morning cap silvery ringlets lined her forehead giving her a disarmingly youthful look. Long ago she'd explained to the man she was watching that even though her name was Martha, her father had dubbed her Patsy because he thought Martha too serious and weighty. Now this man was almost the only one left who called her Patsy.<br><br>She started across the room and went up to him. "Are you ready to go?" she asked. "It's getting late."<br><br>He turned quickly, looked puzzled for an instant, then wrenched himself back into the present. With a sheepish expression he reached for his black military hat and yellow kid gloves. "Indeed, after professing to have longed for this day, it would seem unfit to be tardy for my deliverance," he commented wryly. He pulled on his gloves then sighed, "It really is over, isn't it, Patsy?"<br><br>For a moment her expression became anxious. "You don't mind giving up, do you, my dear? You're surely not sorry that you didn't accept another term."<br><br>He put his hat under his arm and now his eyes twinkled. "My dear, if John Adams is as happy to enter this office as I am to leave it, he must be the happiest man in the world."<br><br>f0 Lightly he touched his lips to her cheek. "I won't be long," he told her, "and then if Lady Washington will not mind spending her afternoon with a private citizen..."<br><br>"I wish I were going with you now," she said.<br><br>He shook his head. "Since Mrs. Adams couldn't be here to watch John take the oath of office, your presence might point up her absence."<br><br>Then he was gone. His valet, Christopher, was waiting downstairs to open the front door. Usually Christopher said, "Good-bye, Mr. President," but now he only bowed. The words had trembled and died on his lips as he realized that he would never be saying them again. But after he closed the door behind the tall old gentleman, he whispered softly, "Good-bye, Mr. President."<br><br>The wind whipped around the wide-rimmed black hat. He raised his hand to steady it, then quickly braced himself and with a rapid stride started down the block. A small cluster of people were waiting on the street just beyond the grounds of the executive mansion. They bowed and he nodded to them. He heard their footsteps behind him as he turned in the direction of Federal Hall.<br><br>The full blast of the March gale pushed hard against him and he leaned forward slightly. He had a fleeting thought that he should have ordered the carriage, but it was a relatively short walk and there was something about going to this ceremony on foot that appealed to him. It was less obtrusive and he wanted to be unobtrusive now.<br><br>Maybe he needed this bit of solitude, too. One had to adjust to the end of the road as thoroughly as one adjusted to its beginning.<br><br>The beginning...In a way it seemed only yesterday that his mother had warned him about always dreaming and never accomplishing. But it wasn't yesterday. That was over fifty years ago when he was a lad of twelve or thirteen and back at Ferry Farm.<br><br>The coldness of the March air faded into the bleak chill of a forbidding parlor. The crunching of his boots became the tapping of his foot on the uncarpeted floorboards. The stark branches of the trees took on the appearance of the depressing furniture in his mother's home. He was absorbed in the memory of that home as he continued on the last walk he would ever take as President of the United States...<br><br><i>March, 1745<br><br>3 P.M.<br><br>Ferry Farm</i><br><br>His foot tapped against the floor as he sprawled uncomfortably on one of the stiff old chairs in the parlor at Ferry Farm. As always he'd had a time becoming absorbed in his book. There was something forbidding and uncomfortable about the spartanly furnished room, about the house itself.<br><br>He was a scant thirteen but had already decided that when he grew up, his home would be warm and welcoming. It would have fine papers on the walls and a marble chimney, papier-m�ch� on the ceilings and neat mahogany tables which could be joined together for company. George spent much time envisioning that home.<br><br>Sighing, he turned back to his reader. Once more he shifted, trying to find a comfortable position. There simply didn't seem to be room enough for his legs anymore -- in the past year he'd gained three inches, was now nearly 6 feet 1 inch, and did not seem to be finished growing. Even his shoulders were pushing their way out of the plain shirting that his mother considered suitable garb.<br><br>His book that day was the <i>Young Man's Companion</i>. His favorite lines in it were:<br><br><i>Get what you get honestly.<br><br>Use what you get frugally.<br><br>That's the way to live comfortably<br><br>And die honorably.</i><br><br>The book slid from his lap. He would have a useful life. Long ago he'd promised his mother that he'd live up to her family's motto. Mary Ball Washington was a difficult woman to please, but that promise had pleased her and evoked one of her rare moments of tenderness.<br><br>George thought again of the story he'd heard of when his mother first came into this house as a bride. His father carried her over the threshold and the first thing her eye fell on was the family copy of Matthew Hale's <i>Contemplations</i>. The housekeeper had left the book open at the page that bore the signature of her husband's first wife.<br><br>Mary Washington said to her husband, "Put me down, please." Firmly she walked over to the book, picked up a pen, and wrote her own name, boldly and with flourishes. The new mistress was very much in charge from that day on.<br><br>George loved his mother but he didn't like her very much. Since his father's death when George was eleven he'd tried to be the man of the house for her, but Mary Washington allowed no smidgen of authority to be taken from her even by her own son. She took care of her brood, wrangled with the overseers who handled the vast lands her husband had left to her and the children, and carried a leather whip at her belt to ensure obedience from her offspring.<br><br>George had an uneasy conscience about the fact that he was much happier during his long visits to his half brothers Augustine and Lawrence. They lived on their own estates now. Lawrence on the Hunting Creek land that he'd renamed Mount Vernon, and Augustine on the Rappahannock Farm near Fredericksburg.<br><br>Both young men seemed to understand George's feelings because he was frequently invited to spend long periods of time with them. "And how is your good mother?" Lawrence would ask when George arrived. "The same?"<br><br>"The same," George would say, hoping that a wry note did not creep into his voice. He wished he could love his mother more. And then he'd forget her and settle into the comfortable atmosphere of his brothers' homes and families.<br><br>Now his mother stalked into the room. "Idle?" Her spare figure was even straighter than usual. The nostrils of her roman nose suggested a sniff...always a dangerous sign.<br><br>George sprang up. "No, madame. I have been reading my meditations." Lamely he pointed to the book which had slid unnoticed to the floor.<br><br>His mother picked it up. "It is not enough to read about how to live life, or to dream it. It is quite more important to do something about it. Are your chores finished?"<br><br>"Yes, Mother." He hesitated a moment. It was probably a dangerous time to bring up a sore subject but intense desire to know his mother's mind pushed him on. "And, Mother, have you given further thought to my going to sea?"<br><br>It was the wrong time. His mother's eyebrows, thick and well-shaped, drew into an almost unbroken line. "I see no need to think about it today. I have at least three years longer to give that subject my thoughts." She turned and stalked from the room.<br><br>She'd only been gone a moment when his sister Betty slipped in. "Is she vexed with you again?" Betty asked anxiously.<br><br>George smiled a welcome. Betty was only a year younger than he and they'd always been close. He wondered again how she had ever been their mother's daughter. Betty was pretty, gay, and lighthearted. She always had a light novel tucked in her workbasket. She never walked but seemed to dance across a room. Oddly, of all the children, she got along best with the mother.<br><br>She and George understood each other completely and shared dreams. Betty, too, had her own ideas about her future home. "I shall have the very grandest house in all Fredericksburg," she often said. "It shall be built just for me and have great beams and fine brass, a beautiful reception hall with lovely, lovely furnishings. And I shall be the mistress in the finest gowns from London. I'll have lots of company and be very gay all the time and not live like this." Whenever she got to that part of her dream, she would give a near sniff and look greatly like her mother.<br><br>Now she stood in front of her tall brother and looked at him adoringly.<br><br>George cupped her chin in his hand. "God help the young men in a year or two. No, little one, she isn't really vexed. She just wants to get vexed about something, so beware."<br><br>Betty giggled. "Well, if she goes to the kitchen, she'll have plenty of reason. Cook's new assistant has vastly overcooked the pork and cook is in a state."<br><br>George groaned. "Dinner should be a pleasant affair indeed. Thank God I'm off for Mount Vernon tomorrow."<br><br>Betty sighed. "I'm glad for you but how I shall miss you. You love Mount Vernon very much, don't you?"<br><br>George considered a moment. "Yes," he said. "Lawrence and Anne are so kind to me but it's more than that. That land...just the way the sun shines on it, or the snow blankets it in white. The way it looks in autumn when the great trees are losing their leaves. It's the joy of riding across the acres next door to Belvoir and visiting with the Fairfaxes. It's riding home again late, when evening shadows are touching the house and the sun is sinking and the Potomac is half dark, half gleaming. Yes, Betty, I truly love Mount Vernon."<br><br><i>March 4, 1797<br><br>11:55 A.M.<br><br>Philadelphia</i><br><br>The firing of the cannons brought him sharply back to the present. Of course, the cannons were being fired to signify the momentous event that was about to take place. For a moment he thought of the cannons that had purchased this moment -- the ones that had shattered the silence of '74 and '75.<br><br>There was a great crowd outside the building of the Congress. It parted quickly to let him pass. He began to climb the steps. And then the applause began. It started tentatively, one single pair of hands clapping, then like a flash it swept through the assemblage.<br><br>The sound preceded him so that when he came in sight of the lower chamber of the House, the members were already on their feet. A burst of applause greeted his entrance. It rose in volume and pushed against the ceiling and walls of the great room. It mingled with the ovation which the people outside continued to offer.<br><br>He quickened his pace, anxious to reach his seat so that the tribute might end. "Not for me," he thought. Not today. But when he reached his place and stood there the tremendous sound didn't abate; it reached a crescendo then softened and died reluctantly.<br><br>Jefferson was the next to arrive. The President watched as the tall aristocratic figure made his way through the room. He was wearing a long blue frock coat and his even patrician features betrayed none of the turmoil that might well be expected of the Vice-president-elect.<br><br>They had often opposed each other in their views, so much so that Jefferson had resigned from the cabinet. But George eyed his old friend affectionately. He would not admit, even to himself, that much as he and Jefferson had differed in many ways, he could warm to the man far better than he could to John Adams.<br><br>He thought of the day in '76 when the messenger had come to his New York headquarters, bearing a copy of the Declaration of Independence. He'd opened it slowly. For months he'd been begging for a statement like this and fearing it would never come. Even after a year of conflict some members of Congress still talked about an eventual reunion with England. He'd tried to point out that armies must fight for a cause; they must have a goal. Independence was a mighty word. It made it possible for a man to put up with starvation and misery. It drove out fear. And still many of the lawmakers vacillated about making a final break with the mother country.<br><br>Finally he'd been promised that a formal document would be issued. In the hopelessness of that first New York campaign he waited for it and wondered just how weak and carefully hedged it would be. The news that Tom Jefferson was charged with the responsibility of writing it made him cautiously optimistic. Jefferson was young but he wrote with the bold pen of a dedicated man. Then when he read the Declaration and absorbed the full richness and power of it, the majesty and breathtaking vision of it, he exultantly ordered that it be proclaimed to all the troops. That evening he stood at the door of headquarters and watched the expressions on the men's faces as a booming voice cried: "When in the course of human events..."<br><br>A stirring in the chamber announced the fact that the President-elect had arrived. George knew that Adams had ordered a new coach-and-four for this day. He'd refused to let even Patsy make him comment on the fact, but had been content to remind her...</p>
